in the past several years i let myself in both hard and some danger .
i went to prison - tough
i work in a the coal before - dangerous .
i taken in war zones - both hard and dangerous film .
i once in 30十 days only eat this a food - a started interesting to the middle , a little tough , and finally , pretty dangerous .
actually , i career most time i always let myself in in harsh the situation of purpose is through more attract people , more interesting way to study social hope can put these problems in the form of entertainment show present before audience .
so , when i know myself future to here doing about brands and sponsored tedtalk i realized i want to play dots new pattern .
you might somebody heard few weeks ago , i got a ads on ebay
again on facebook and twitter throve some information i let people have opportunity i buy 2011 tedtalk 冠名 power
yeah , somewhere lucky personal or company profitable sex or nonprofit sexual will get my life only opportunity - because i sure would chris anderson never allow like this happen second - to buy you are viewing this speeches 冠名 power that time , this speeches have not sure title , also without much content no give any associated with theme clue
so what you get is : you really calls for your here : for my ted talk theme know nothing and , their content decided i eventually whether would put it blown if i make you and expensive company shameless big just did , it possibilities .
but say back this is ads wonderful opportunity .
you know how people in see tedtalks ?
people can much .
by the way , this is just talk 暂定 title .
though made this argue i still believe have people will buy the 冠名 power
if year ago you ask me i will not like now so 理直气壮
but , in i were up new project , also is i new film we to a human , advertising world marketing world what
as i said earlier this few years , i always make ourselves into the situation of terrible but with this than , most by but let me most let i tasted it tries 苦头 is also most dangerous experience heading off with these people share a studio somewhere .
you see , i had this a film creative
and video 摩根 de 斯普尔 洛克 : i shot think so a film about advertising implant , marketing , and 广告宣传 and film sponsored was from advertising implant , marketing , and 广告宣传
the name will 定为 film quot history most 卖座 film & quot ;
& quot ; history most 卖座 film from on to down , from all with bits brand - from put in name ago film sponsors is brand x .
this brand , qualcomm stadium 史泰普 center ...
these people life with film eternal to combination in together - forever
film exploration is such a ideas - michael 坎森 : this some repeat ;
what have ? and michael de 坎森 : this some repeat eternal , forever ?
i talk often mean repeat and michael de 坎森 : i is 随口 on ;
this is to emphasize
it is & quot ; eternal . forever . & quot ;
but not only will we marks 某某 brand sponsors want in film will every a series products sell should brand out
this , we sell out a shoes , this shoes is be history most blend foot shoes ...
& quot ; history most 卖座 film best of car is history best open car history drink drink , moreover make film become quot history most 卖座 film & quot ;
泽维尔 de 柯查尔 : so is said , is not just show brand is people part of life but let these brand sponsored this film ? & 斯普尔 洛克 : make these brand sponsored film ;
the 普尔 洛克 : actually , we will show marketing 全过程
this film taken goal is transparency
in film , you will witness brands marketing 全过程
this is whole movie idea 从头至尾 , fits film
i hope ceg can helped 一臂之力
robert . know : interesting is first hear this idea when i think this is in most honorable 敬意 for audience represent
but i can not know people accept
泽维尔 de 柯查尔 : for that you is there an expected - i want to use this word & quot ; positions , not because it brought have negative colors - you think that film produce to what results ? & 斯普尔 洛克 : not know ;
david much . 柯 well : taken this film need money ?
1.5 million good david de 柯恩 : ;
john kamen : i think want to deal with these brand will very difficult but , seek these big brands support certainly worth a try
泽维尔 de 柯查尔 : who know god , your film out later we may into a group of 胡吹 sea 侃 moron
the 普尔 洛克 : what you think they would do out answer ?
the 图尔特 . 鲁德尔弗 : they most would reject
the 普尔 洛克 : why they refused is film itself is still because i himself ?
john kamen : all have
the 普尔 洛克 : situation 不容乐观 ah
gentlemen , can you help me ? i need help .
michael 坎森 : i can help you
the 普尔 洛克 : too well . and michael 坎森 : very good .
wonderful .
michael 坎森 : we must targeted brand
the 普尔 洛克 : yeah . so michael de 坎森 : this very difficult .
you going to deal with the those people ...
michael 坎森 : we have some people 脉 . & 斯普尔 洛克 : okay .
put cameras off
the 普尔 洛克 : i thought , & quot ; put cameras off & quot ; mean is do 私下 discussion
results , it means & quot ; we not want and you movie d run on any relationship . & quot ;
the 普尔 洛克 : like that , these companies a then a , 统统 disappeared
no a people willing for film help
i very astonishingly
they for this project that no any interested
i mind , i thought , ads idea with matter is take you products out in front of as many people to get as many people see your product
especially in world today new old medium 纵横交错 in fragmented media 天下 don should not transmit a new 传送方式 put adopted this information to fertile citizens ? .
no , this just i personally idea
problem , you saw my idea there a fatal mistakes this wrong in here .
not actually , that might point wrong all no
this problem is not in
this is can accept .
but , this picture represent problem of those
you see , if you search & quot ; transparency in google pictures and transparency & quot ; this is - this is row in search results causes one of the images
i love you . , 谢尔盖 de 布林 and google ; one 创始人
this is problem in : transparency - never 弄虚作假 transparent public simple accessible iconic information visible , things accessible properties and business works connected - last a technology is probably the biggest problem
you see , recently we often hear transparency this word
our president politicians , we even all the ceo in use this word
however , turn to into practice when situation 陡然 happened
why ? transparency is flooding beast - like this by just turn them but still in 吼叫 bear
it amazing 捉摸 badly - not as this line of strange a small
looks 凶险 abnormal
so what else 凶险 is ?
eat an entire big bowl cool whip cream
pretty 凶险
when i started talking with corporations tell them we to tell a story they said this : & quot ; oh , we certainly want you stories conclusion
we hope you stories , we just hope you tell our story . & quot ;
when i was a child my father sometimes find i in 扯谎 - he in use he 一贯 way staring at me see - he would say : & quot ; son , every a story have three sided .
here have your story , have my story , and true story . & quot ;
you see , we hope through film to tell real story
and only one company would help me - because i years of with john bond and richard de 科尔申波姆 交情 - i realized , please people not as please himself i must skip between units with my team directly with that company negotiation
you suddenly started realizing - or when i started realizing - you start with these companies understanding of words when itself brand for you is a common problem
and video 斯普尔 洛克 : i have two friend is taken hollywood big film i still recognize like me make small cost independent film friends
and i those shot hollywood movie friends tell me , the reason they movie success benefit of their brand sponsors
and i those make little cost independent film friends said : & quot ; how can we accomplished these hollywood largest film make ? & quot ;
and this a movie is called history most 卖座 film
so in film how we will view ban this brand ?
whenever i prepared went out , whenever i open cabinet you all will see ban ’ ve bodily fluids
whenever i person to for with something i would say : & quot ; for , you enough 清新 today ?
you ready ? you look a little nervous .
let me help you relaxed about .
maybe you can before for use some . & quot ;
we put that these 怡 people ’ ve bodily fluids out out
whatever is & quot ; four bathed 花香 & quot ; or & quot ; heaven 风韵 always have a few serves you
man ladies launched these products - we would also dimension type solid , walk type of , or 膏状 , various ’ ve bodily fluids 一应俱全
this is roughly situation
now i will answer any question you good let you know more situation
凯伦 de frank : we is a 知名度 small brand
like you say to little cost film we just early brand is a
we not like other big brands 财大气粗
and undertake such propaganda - you know can caused people to ban attention - this is attract our place
the 普尔 洛克 : you will use what word to describe ban this brand ?
ban very how
凯伦 de frank : ask better
woman : sophisticated technology
the 普尔 洛克 : technology are not the best described way ’ ve bodily fluids of 腋下 is people threw product
man : we talk about bold , 清新
i thought & quot ; 清新 is this a series of products positive 写照 with & quot ; inhibit 体味 , 干爽 comfort by corresponds
it makes you feel 清新
how you let body enduring 清新 - more 清新 three times 清新
these all produce 积极效果 can
that was 身家 millions of an enterprise corporation ah
that i ? how did a ordinary want ?
i have necessary ask the street people they like me , is man nail 乙 丙 dante
they need tell their brand
and video 斯普尔 洛克 : how you will describe you brand ?
man : i brand ?
i not know
i like very good costume
the 复 1980s 古风 combination 滑板 朋 gram style unless today is laundry day
the 普尔 洛克 : ok , the in , what is brand ?
: differently and in the 斯普尔 洛克 : differently ;
man : i think style is what i specialized should is & quot ; 暗色 mystery emotional intelligence
i love the things like black gray
i will often wear a package like 太阳眼镜 i also liked 水晶 package
woman : if dan is a brand that he might is a few classic 敞篷车 like 梅塞德斯 . 奔驰
man 2 : i brand i called it eclectic
woman 2 : slightly hippie , slightly yoga slightly brooklyn girl flavor - i not know
men three : i love pet dogs
my pet toys 销 down national , even worldwide
i think that is i brand
and in this distorted little industry , this is my brand
men four : i brand is fedex ; i is the 送货
men five : & quot ; falls breaking the alcoholism writer cards
this count ?
lawyers : i brand is lawyer
tom : i is & quot ; tom cards
the 普尔 洛克 : can we can all become & quot ; tom cards , but i often find yourself is & quot ; 暗色 mystery emotional intelligence & quot ; and & quot ; eclectic combination body
i realized , i need is a woman experts
i set a mathematician can read what my inner think , a woman can really help i understand where for & quot ; brand personality people
so i found a company called olson in pittsburgh zaltman company
they helped 雀巢 , 宝洁 companies febreze , 贺曼 and hallmark wait brand discovered they brand personality
if they can help those brand , then they certainly can help i
and video 艾比加尔 : you take pictures all brought right ?
the 普尔 洛克 : i took . first picture is i 全家福
艾比加尔 : tell me this picture has what connection with you 感想 to yourself
the 普尔 洛克 : these people helped me form for world view
what 艾比加尔 : this is a world
the 普尔 洛克 : this world ? i think is your world you live world - the all people around you , your friends , family your lifestyle , you work
this all have a 生根 发芽 发芽 places and for me this place is my home in west virginia
艾比加尔 : next a picture ?
the 普尔 洛克 : next slide : this is my most happy a day
艾比加尔 : this has what connection with you to yourself view ?
the 普尔 洛克 : this about what i want to be
i love novel things
i like strange things
艾比加尔 : told i & quot ; why & quot ; - this to have what we help ?
that put bend knives represent what ? you now motivated by which incubation stage ?
so important 重整旗鼓 why ? what red represent ?
please explain this a part
said about what not fit you style
you after what 蜕变 ?
what is not necessarily fear . you sit is what ever mountain car ?
the 普尔 洛克 : yuk ... ! and 艾比加尔 : thank . no , i thank you
艾比加尔 : thank you patience collaboration . & 斯普尔 洛克 : you do very good .
艾比加尔 : right . & 斯普尔 洛克 : very much . good .
ahh , i not know how the end result
this there too things more complex complex .
林赛 de left megawatt 曼 : this idea of that first impression your brand personality have two radically unlike but 相辅相成 two sides - 摩根 de 斯普尔 洛克 brand is a both have minds and 玩世不恭 brand
these two together really good
this funny almost form a contradiction body
i think some companies often only 偏重 its one of advantage and will not both 兼顾
most companies predilection to - this is also 人之常情 - avoiding they grasp not nobody things avoiding fear etc and you doesn opposite . you actually put these all become the positive factor , this is very good of
so same brand are what ?
first is the classic , apple
the other target - wii mini mini of coopers , have jetblue
some brand is & quot ; 玩世不恭 , some brands is have ideas depth and these are lasting but not a brand both have minds depth , and some 玩世不恭 brand , is very have power of
the 普尔 洛克 : a 玩世不恭 , have minds brand . so your brand ? again
if someone let you describe yourself brand identity , your brand personality how would you describe ?
whether you 高调 ? you will make people 心潮澎湃 ?
or is low-key brand ?
whether your brand greater 沉稳 , 矜持 , conservative ?
高调 brand generally rather 玩世不恭 like fresh prince that novelty fashion , like 埃罗尔 de 弗林 forward-thinking adventure , bold get , flexible , secular , 霸气 like 甘道夫 magic again mysterious
or you brand greater low-key ?
you like james bond place , around for 老道 ?
whether you fame 显赫 , traditional , 孜孜不倦 , conservative like 奥普拉 煽 ?
whether you trustworthy , 稳重 , familiar safe , reliable , sacred with ideas and wisdom like dalai lama or 尤达 swami and star anti-war characters that ?
in this film we found over 500 company 高调 or low-key brands they said : not ; they not willing relationships with the film d run on any
they not willing , major relationships with d run on film is because eventually they no control they can not control product
but eventually we still get 17 collaboration company they d control surrender they willing and like me both have minds and 玩世不恭 people collaboration they put tell stories power completely empower us tell the story arcane statement - the story advertisers dig deep never
they let we tell stories about nerves marketing learn we in the movies introduce how they first find through mri technology in your brain control desire please area again do advertising , taken marketing guilt movie
we go to ban outdoor advertising sao paulo
this city in past five years entire no expectations any billboards , d any poster , no weirdly any propaganda alone , no nothing
we go school district in here these companies , trying to put advertising 打入 全美 all fiscal nervous schools
let me unexpected is , let me get most much feedback or let me get the biggest harvest actually is i try it to processing those things
these brand is how do .
they skip 中间人 , skip 中介 think , these 中介 might not have put my interests on song woman
i will directly with artists negotiation
i will and he together create a movie 不同凡响 movies made people from absorb it will inverted we think about world
this for people had what impact ? do success ?
film on 圣丹斯 film festival song degrees up , we look at
according to burrelles data , film since january song degrees up - this is not the whole movie - we get media for a time of nine billion should movie coverage
all coverage add up when long for two weeks half
this also just the web situation - not including newspaper magazine , or television
film even no launched
network no can not in line on watching
also no in other countries released .
finally film already got widely attention
for this a film points , this is a good grades we were find ad company all advice client to participate not
i believe if you try was , was risk keeping these risk would be opportunity
i believe when you not let people adventure you is in push they fail
i believe , when you education to risk , then you is not your employees in will entire company interests placed danger
i think want to get progress we just must encourage people was adventure
we must encourage people not afraid seem dangerous opportunity
ultimately , moving forward i think we must face fear
must locked that bear into cage
face fear face risk
a 口接 a bite , face risk
eventually , we must embrace transparency
now , any time than ever little integrity can produce strong resilience
i said : through integrity with transparent my whole talk & quot ; embrace transparency they sponsored by i in emc friend are coming out with 7100 dollars on ebay net buy the talk 冠名 power
emc : get large data for huge opportunity good global businesses
emc for you present & quot ; embrace transparency
very thank you
june de 柯 翰 : so , 摩根 for 贯彻 transparency goal that 7100 dollars by get where to conclusion ?
the 普尔 洛克 : this problem ask too well .
i pocket have one check is ted 母公司 seeds foundation and sapling foundation open a picture 7100 dollars check as i next year ted 出场 order
you good afternoon .
i something want to show you .
take this as a pixels , a flight pixels .
we in the lab , called it sensing design .
let me introduce this thing for you
now if you took this picture - i is italian people , every italy boy bedroom has this picture to with their older wall .
but i showed you this reason is because some interesting things happen in f1 equation game in in the last few decades .
ago , if you want to in f1 game in 夺冠 , you just need have budget , then put your budget betting in a good 车手 和好 car .
if your car and 车手 good enough , that you will 夺冠 .
now , if you want to 夺冠 , in fact you need also other something like this - some can real-time test racing equipment it links thousand sensors can put collecting to car related data , transmit 进系统 in , and processing and use this to feedback decisions give car itself make it real-time change do and information collect in synchrony .
this is , use the engineer phrase , called real-time surveillance .
basically , this system including two components a is sensors one is actuators
now , interesting is this real-time surveillance re started penetrate into we life .
our cities , in years past , what has been network , electrons industrial covers .
they become like wireless e-mail 放电脑 .
meanwhile , as wireless e-mail put computers , they start doing out different response passed can sense and braking .
if we can optimize city , actually this is a flying .
sentence problem outside words , i want to say , city only two percent of the earth surface , but they occupies world population 50 percent .
they energy consumption 75 percent of world - producing 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we optimize city , that would is a flying .
based on these cities , all these sensor sense and braking are entering we daily in everyday things .
this is beau pull this year summer de 安东内利 an exhibition in new york modern art museum organization .
theme for conversation with i . & quot ;
we things , we environment , is in started give we feedback .
some sense , like every atoms in become sensors and 制动器 .
also that fundamentally changed we as humans and nature relationship .
some sense , this is absolutely meters 开朗 琪 ron ancient dream ...
you know , when meters 开朗 琪 ron sculpting moses like when , in finally he picks up 铁锤 , throwing to moses like - actually you also see elton that little 凹槽 - said , 咆哮 around , & quot ; you why not speak , why ? & quot ;
today , first , we environment started give we feedback .
i will show a few case - have a time , as we consciousness to sensing and answer we environment .
let we passed from sense stage started .
i want to share give you first project is actually one of our lab initial a few project .
that is in four years six months before italy .
we in there do is actually used then of a new network now already covers global - phone network - and through this networks collect any of 终端 illumination the fighter integrate seen information to understand how cities are works .
when summer is a lucky summer -2006年 .
this is just italy in world cup 夺冠 year . .
some of you may remember , have debate italy for french competition , then 齐达内 终场 ago , that 个头 槌 .
anyway , italian last win .
now watch what happens day start using grid to real-time demo happen situation .
you now see cities .
you see 正中 rome circular big theater , computer 伯河 .
this is morning , competition ago .
you look at top timeline .
中午 , here there people with call , walking around .
competition started - quiet .
法国队 进球 . italy for 进球 .
half debate , a call you quickly , on a toilets .
next half debate , competition end
first add when , second add when .
benki which within , head 槌 that time .
italy win . 哈哈 .
night , everybody to downtown celebrate .
you can see rush .
second day , everybody to downtown welcome 凯旋 team and minister .
then 人流 started down .
you see graph on this place called horse west mo 赛场 , from rome period started , people go there celebrate - would have a great party , in 这天 end see rush .
said , this is just now how we feel this city one example , use this way we could not do a few years ago .
another briefly about perception example : this time is not about people , but about we use and stuff consumption .
today , we know every same where something comes from .
this is a map show you all a apple computer 零配件 , how self-assembly together .
but we do extremely less know where these 零配件 last disposal .
so this project , we actually invented some small tag track these waste to make it move in system .
actually we and some volunteers those together in seattle willing help we volunteers , just before year , to those people stuff discard claim the tag - different varieties things , like you see these - those we anyway all to throw things .
we put little 集成块 , little tag , post on those garbage and started tracking it .
this is we see results .
from seattle ...
a week later .
from these we realized system of information have too much inefficient works .
i can actually use less energy do the same thing .
this data previously still not use .
but have many garbage transportation and 费解 thing happened .
and another we believe thing if we want to those we dumpster cup day , it not disappear , it still in on earth somewhere corner .
we throw day d plastic bottle also is would there .
if we put this show people , then we also can promoting some change in behavior .
so this is meaning in this project .
i at mit colleague , 阿萨夫 de 彼得曼 , he would tell you more about perception and many we use cognition can do amazing thing , but i want to start second part to start , this is actually about our environment .
first project is about we few years ago in spain 萨拉戈萨 do .
it started a question , he mayor proposed find we said southern spain that europe use architecture , in public heals with water traditions .
question is : technologies , new technology , how to make it 锦上添花 ?
one was ideas from mit a research group is about , imagine a pipe , you have it valves , 电磁阀 , 读数 table , open again shut .
you create a use water as pixels water 帘 .
if these pixels falls down , you can on it create , you can shows spend answers , image , text .
when you close it , it will even closed to let you skip , like you see this picture .
we put this show 贝洛克 mayor .
he loved it .
then we get the in expo entrance build a building building allowed .
we called it numbers water pavilion .
whole building use build and water into .
no door or window , but when you walk into it , it would automatically is corner let you into .
roof is also by water covers around .
if a little wind , if you want less water without out , you actually can put roof reduce some .
or even off whole building buildings , that this will disappear , like this building looks like .
these days , you will often in winter could see this scenes when they reduce roof been to there of people will say , & quot ; they in demolished this architecture . & quot ;
no , they no activists it , just when it down , architecture ben birth was almost disappear .
this is water architectural work situation .
you can see people for how into represent very frustration .
this is i in try not let ourselves get wet , in test beat 开水 帘 sensors .
i should tell you have night happened then all of sensors stop work .
but this make become more interesting that evening .
all kids in 萨拉戈萨 meet this building , because into buildings way gets some different .
building longer will automatically open let you into , but buildings are still be water 帘 cut of different space that you have skip this time to not get wet yourself .
also , for us , this very interesting , because , as an architect , an engineer , a designer , we often thinking how people use we design things .
but reality always unexpected .
this is also do these things glamour are use and interactive same in .
this is a picture using physics pixels , using water made , and on top do projection
and it reminded me next project i want to show you .
this is , imagine this these like 素能飞 .
imagine you will have a small can in air moving helicopter , and every top have a little can it transforms can lighting . pixels - almost like a piece of in air moving clouds .
see a video .
imagine a shelf helicopter , like we just saw the kind , and other helicopter , synchronized , moving .
therefore you got this cloud .
you get a can bend screen or show panels , like this - a two-dimensional ordinary configuration .
or regular , but three-dimensional , here , change is points of light , not pixels position .
you can use different approach .
imagine you displays can use different size or scale , use different 清晰度 to came out .
but all of everything is only a 3d pixels cloud points you pull and through it and can from many , many angle watching .
this is manipulated . down like just form standard grid .
when you turned one on , you actually look of this . and we before the same .
imagine if every one of them is being what people control .
you can make every pixels has from people there get corresponds input , from people moving , etc .
something i show you some first display .
we are and collaboration , 罗伯托 de twitter stream train the top ballerina today - new york 大都会 art museum and milan the one who 卡拉 opera stars - to real when capture he 3d movement to use it to
you can see 罗伯托 in dancing .
can you in the pixels points , different the left
this is all real-time 3维 scans and motion capture .
that you can 重现 this whole 舞步 .
you can always this jump .
but , once you have these pixels , you can manipulate they use colored and motion gravity and spinning to manipulate .
we want to use this to as a type of flight fire possible input sides .
i want to show you one last we in do project .
it is we for london olympic and do .
it called digital cloud .
this idea of sources , again , play imagine , can we engage you to do something to change environment - is to sponsored our digital cloud build - like 谷仓 building , but is numbers cloud .
think you can let everybody give out a pixels money .
i think past few years happen what things is extraordinary is , over several decades , we went physical world to digital world transformation .
now electronics . , knowledge , be linked into internet 端口 everywhere .
today , first - obama campaign tell us - we can from digital world headrest spontaneous organizations network power return to physical world .
this is we viable , use this example , we want to use it to design and creative a logo .
it will means certain architecture in cities build .
but future it can is it can solve today increasingly interactions challenges - think about climate change or - how we from digital world return to carbon physics world way .
so we can actually let you collective engagement do this thing together .
this is numbers cloud cloud , and use pixels form , use in reality cloud form way use particles to form cloud same .
these particles is water , this digital cloud is pixels form cloud .
this is in london of
you can walking into one , feel different experience .
you can actually in down see , 2012年 olympic important moment , and really use it to as connected society bridges .
simultaneously heaven clouds and some you can tip arriving , like london new hill .
you can into one .
this is a whole new digitization night 火炬 - but most important is , create one . anybody can reach peak experience
thank you .
i called 阿密 megawatt
18月 ago , i in google have another work with my boss i proposed this idea want in art and museum ways do things i boss also here today she agreed .
has 18 months
experience many interesting negotiations and story , i can talking to you walked nine countries , contact 17 a very interesting museum
but i first to focus introduce this demo
i can many stories to explain why we want to do this
i personally story very simple wrote on the slide light with is how into & visit these art ;
i grew up in india
i got a very good education , i not want complaining what but i no very much visit these museum and art of opportunity
so when i had opportunity tourist very visit these museum i learn started many things
when i work in google later i 萌发 into technology make it easier for you into visit idea
so we built a team , a great team we started doing this work
i first into demo and then tell you a couple of this project launch after a few interesting story
so , very simple , you to googleartproject . at worldchanging.com.
you see all these museum
you see 乌菲兹 museum , you see new york museum 艾尔米塔什 modern art museum , dutch national museum , van high museum
now let me to one of my favorite new york 大都会 art museum
have two into ways , simple
click , boom , you into museum ,
wherever you are mumbai , mexico , all irrelevant
you around . everywhere , you just enjoy
you want in museum press 平面图 walking a loop
you put 平面图 open click a , jumped in
you just went in , you want walk to hallway end
continue walk , play happy
explore output
thank you . i have not tell to the good part ?
now i face i favorite a painting peter 勃鲁盖尔 harvest the
i saw this number +
if museum give we imagery , you click it
this is one of the 幅图象
here is all the neurons data information
if you really interested in this art you can click here , but now i first locked it give .
this is we take a diagram like this is we so-called 千兆 象素 technology
like , this imagery , approaching 10 billion a pixels
many people all asked i quot ; you from 10 billion a pixels in get what ? & quot ;
now i just give you see 10 billion a pixels give you what
you can 简便 to contract
you see some interesting things
i loved this guy , he expressions is 无价 of
but you really want to further deep one
so i just everywhere look i see a situation here
i said , & quot ; wait , this interesting . & quot ;
near , i started notice what these kids are in throwing stuff
i study , imagine with museum a few people 联系人 talking about discovering that this is a game called & # 91 不明 -rsb- , use sticks play geese in 礼拜二 confession - day
actually don very popular
i not know why they doing but i learned some new stuff
now into more deep again , you can see 裂痕 .
now let me you look vision i to shrinking scene , you can really see all
this is our site this is painting that
the best not talk about ? , wait yet
now let we immediately into new york modern art museum
i another favorite : & quot ; 星夜
i just tell you example is all about detail
that if you want to see 笔法 ?
if you want to see exactly how van high created this painting .
you zoom in , amplification really
i push close to my favorite part i really can see 裂痕
this is & quot ; 星夜 i think , i never seen that it
i want to introduce you to another i like function
here many things , i no time display introduce
this is really cool a part , called collection
you anyone , anybody whether you rich is still is poverty whether whether you have a fancy house , irrelevant
you can into , build your own network museum in these work build collections
very simple , you into i created this power called 变焦 you can look everywhere constantly 变焦
this is 艺术馆 countries quot ; messenger are & quot ;
you can write : , and sent friends really unfolds discussion explore you appreciate these . 感想
so i thought , very broadly about for me , the main is these 精湛 artwork is not from google
i personally think it also is not even from museum
i may not should say
it really artists from these
this is me in this process of 谦诚 feelings
i mean i hope this digital media can for their arts win 公证 right to show their work
and today i get the big question is : & quot ; you do that is to replicate to museum experience ? & quot ;
my answer is not
this is the experience of replenish
i said these , thank
thank
if you can than now you better , you hope is how ?
like , you genes can have some changes that you have better 记忆力 , more accurate , more nobody and faster .
or you want to become more health , more strong , more energy .
you want to get more attractive , more confidence ?
to health live very long , this ?
or , is you want to have more creativity .
what you most want ?
what if you can only have same , you want ?
-lrb- audience : creativity .
creativity .
how many people to choose creativity ?
raise your hand , let me see .
have some . maybe and here we have the number of creativity same more .
that very good .
how many want 记忆力 ?
more some .
health ?
less some .
longevity ?
ah , most . i is doctor , see here i very happy .
if you can have this one change , world will very different .
this is just imagine ?
or say , that maybe may happen ?
evolution is a permanent topic , on ted forum . but today i want to tell you about this subject a doctor view .
20th century famous geneticist , t . 杜布 尚斯基 and t . g . dobzhansky , he also is gotten holy communion of believers , in russia 东正教 church . he wrote an article , called : & quot ; biology everything very hard to say really , unless use evolution ideas to thinking . & quot ;
now , if you is not believe biological evolution evidence now you can switch off your hearing aids when , take out your personal communication devices - you get allows - or see a again 卡瑟林 de 舒尔茨 and kt schulz looking after that book about wrong . because next talk you will feel no meaning .
but if you believe biological evolution , think about this : that is about past , is also about future ?
that is happening to other creatures , or are we will happen ?
this is a picture of life tree diagram .
in this picture , i let 树状 from center look every direction unfolds branching , because if life trees 边角 part , every existing for the , using evolution term of species in those branching sophisticated , is all success , survive . this suggests a serves degrees about it environment .
human part , in this branch , in a 边角 end , is we most interested of course .
we out and modern chimpanzees apart from a common ancestors branch is probably 600 million or 800 million years ago .
in that time , about 20 to 25 a hominid species .
some to ever walked .
we here survival 13 million years .
look , we seems and this life trees other species away far very . but actually , on very 多层面 , form we cells basic basic tectonic is almost the same .
you know ? we can use and apply a ordinary bacteria tectonic to produce human insulin proteins and use to treat diabetes ?
this not human insulin ; this is the same protein in biochemical angle on and we pancreas generate hard distinguish .
bacteria in said to bacteria , you know we belly it more than the cells our body ?
maybe have 10 times more .
you think , when 安东尼奥 de 达马西奥 and antonio rs damasio ask you personally self image when , you would expect bacteria ?
we gut is a very good environment , for those bacteria .
warm , dark , air out , fairly comfortable .
and yet , we will provide give them need almost all nutrients they not order any effort .
for bacteria , that was 逍遥自在 , although have occasionally out by not tend to emissions out .
but still , for bacteria , you is a great life environment , and they to your life is also requires .
they help digest what you need nutrients .
and they also protect you resistance some disease .
but future will is how ?
balance on whether we already in evolution , as a species ?
or , our fate is would into other different species - other can maybe adapt better environment ?
now let we back the big bang , 14 billion years ago - earth , solar system , about 4.5 ago - primitive life originally 跡象 , earth might three , four , four billion years ago - first more cells organisms , is probably in 800 million or 10亿年 ago - and this is human a species finally appeared in last 13 million years .
in this universe large never done symphony , life on earth as a simple scores ; animals , is the single 小节 and human , is a 装饰音 .
that we .
that is also this presentation interesting part , i hope you enjoy .
when i still is university virgin , i on my first festival biology classes .
i was shocked , biology is elegant and beautiful .
i for evolution force and obsessed , and realized a very fundamental things : in most life form of existence , in single-celled organisms , every a cell simple tectonic , and all genetic energy , should cells fire that kept cells inherit warm .
but in more cells organisms out , situation began to change .
have sex reproductive started into image .
and very important is , adopted have sexual reproductive way and deliver the gene , and other parts , become but consumption .
actually , you can say we part of death 必然性 appeared in evolution there and sexual reproduction also happen in
now i have to say when i was college students i thought , well , for sexual sexual / death , sexual / death , and 亡 - sounds still was pretty reasonable , but year past i started producing many questions .
i started understand 乔治伯恩斯 but george burns ; when he , he before always in las vegas performing until he 90 year-old .
a night , somebody break he lived hotel door .
he built door .
appeared in front of he is a beautiful wear have very few 舞女 .
she looks at he said , & quot ; i to here is want do a big love . & quot ;
& quot ; ok , george said , & quot ; that i just drink soup . & quot ; now soup unpronounceable close super . looking after
i since i started realizing as a physician always effort direction is a different from evolution direction direction - is not absolute contradiction , just is different .
i is always in trying to keep
want makes we health .
want makes we recover from the disease .
want we live more lasting more health .
evolution , are convey genes to next generation adapt and survive from the a generation to next .
from evolution view , we is like rocket 助推器 being design into send & quot ; genes charges into down a layer orbit and then 跌落 ocean .
i think we should all understand 伍 dee de allen and woody woody allen said , he said , & quot ; i think through my work and mortal , not
& quot ; i think through not dead and immortal . & quot ;
evolution , not necessarily is to live more lasting .
it not necessarily looking at those 个头 the biggest or strongest , or most fast and not even the smart .
evolution want is the biological can best adapt they environment .
this is a single success survive test .
depth in sea , bacteria are 耐热 they can in hot steam survival otherwise to words , if there is fish , will have 苏斯维 megawatt cook fish , but , they can really make themselves live in a comfortable environment .
so , what it means , when we look back evolution process happening , and we think about the evolution of human again , especially we look on to the next stage , i could say have many possibilities .
first possibility , we will not evolution .
we already achieve some dots balance .
it behind reason is probably , first , we through drugs , could retain many genes those will be eliminated and from most people book they remove genes .
secondly , we can is a allocation our environment of species makes environment to adapt we and we to adapt environment .
another , we immigrant , traveled and mix heterocyclic together that makes you not in in isolated state , and this state again is 必要条件 evolution happens .
second probably , it still is traditional evolution form , natural , by nature power push .
in this controversial is evolution 轮盘 turn to slow , is can not keep out .
only isolated phenomenon exist , and we as a species domination the remote planet which will have isolated phenomenon , environmental change causes evolution nature way evolution .
but have third may , a tempting , interesting and 骇 people of possibilities .
i called it : new evolution - a new way of evolution is not simple nature way , is there mentoring and way by choice we way as individuals to make choices and promoting .
now , how to this happen ?
how we probably let this happen ?
first to consider reality now , people in some culture , they for their offspring do some choices .
some in those culture , they choice more boys redundant girls .
for the society , that must is not good , but this truly is a individuals and family made a choice .
again to think , if you could go choice , is not simple choices you children gender , but choice in your body to do some genes adjust can cure or preventing disease adjust .
if you really can do some gene adjust to eradicate diabetes or 阿尔茨海默 氏 disorder or reduce cancer rates or eradicate stroke ?
t you think about your genes do those change ?
if we look forward , these change will is very have possible .
humans genome plan from 1990 started and use 13 years time .
it cost 27亿 dollars .
done in plan after 2004 , you can do the same thing 20 million dollars , three to four months .
today you can get a complete sequence contains body genes three billion base pairs cost about is two million dollars is probably within a week .
will not too long can achieve thousand dollars human genome , and more people can do .
just in a weeks ago , countries 工程院 and american given & quot ; germany ray 珀 award & quot ; give francis de arnold and francis arnold ; and william de 思特梅尔 and willem stemmer two scientists independent developed technology could makes natural evolutionary process faster and more good idea proteins can to produce more effective . francis de arnold and francis call arnold & quot ; 定向进化 . & quot ;
many years ago , 拉斯克 award speaking albert lasker prize looking after given in the scientists mountain reach 弥 and shinya yamanaka he research is him take use into a mature skin cells invisible , a fiber organization cells and through manipulation just four genes , he led should cells back into a can more stem cells - a had be any cells cells in our body .
these changes in progress .
the same technology is can from producing viruses bacteria in computer-generated body insulin resistance them , would you this will not just protecting produce for other virus our immune system . .
whether you believe , have an experiment in vaccine research prevention flu is from a tobacco cultivating of plants cells .
can you imagine can also of tobacco have beneficial thing ?
these in today are reality , and in future , will have more possible .
there about another two small changes .
you can change yourself cells , that if you of body can change you generations cells ?
if you can change sperm and egg , or is change new 受精卵 , can give you generations better opportunity more healthy lives - eradicate diabetes , cancer chance of eradicate 血友病 , reduce ?
who not want more healthy kids ?
to time , the same deconstruct technology , same technology can produce defense disease change , will allow we can integrating some super properties , ability high level - better 记忆力 .
why not to ken robinson de 詹宁斯 and ken jenniings of some especially you can have and next generation across dw sen computer systems same some ?
why not to rapid contract muscles can make we run faster more more enduring ?
why not live more lasting ?
these will miraculous resistant .
and when we are a position we can transferred to next generation , we can integrating we want ability , we would change old model evolution for new evolution .
we will have this process generally maybe need 10 million years , but we can compressed to 1,000 years - maybe even in next 100 years .
these change our grandchildren or they grandchildren will have .
they would use these choice ? go create a better society ? more successful , more friendly society ?
or we would have selectively choice different ability change we some of those people and not is another some people ?
whether we would create a society more boring and unified ? or more for robust and kinds ?
this is all problem is to let we faced .
and most important , we could propulsion intellectual , or is inherit intellectual to to do these choices , make us more sensible ?
or good or bad quickly , than you imagine we will face to also to quickly these choices .
thank you .
i is jesse , this is my travel box .
but when i show you my load what inside , before i do a very public confess , which is , to my clothes extreme obsessed with .
i ultralight love find them and wear them , recently , still love photos of them and write about their blog , every a differently , 丰富多彩 set , crazy clothes all has its most the proper that a occasions .
but i not buy any new stuff .
i clothes are two hand buy from 跳蚤市场 and 旧货 store .
oh , thank you .
two hand shopping make i reduce buy clothes for environmental impact , and for i his wallet impact .
i can 结识 various interesting people ; can saved money give give charity ; i dressed also since into a pie ; , shopping looking became my private 宝 .
i would think , what i would find today ?
will will not exactly is my size ?
will is i like color ?
will below 20 dollars ?
if answer all is is ; i just think myself win .
i think back to my travel bin tell you are to at ted this exciting a week , i take up what .
what will take this have so many clothes guy ?
so what do i want to give you look i take .
i brought seven lanes 內裤 just these .
exactly a week 內裤 is i travel 箱内 everything .
i bet i in palm springs , would find all clothes i need .
since you now see i , not the & quot ; wearing underwear in ted to walk to women & quot ; - which means i actually found some new stuff .
and now i really want to show you my a week clothes .
is is not sounds nice ?
of course also , i will talk to you still living guidance and whether , whether you believe , these are i in & quot ; old 衣 new wear adventure extract to ideas .
so we start from sunday .
i called this shiny tiger .
you need not use of money can also seem 气质 remarkable .
even you almost always can only spend not to 50 dollars , can impressive .
this whole clothes , including coat use i 五十五 dollars , and this is my this a whole weeks wear most expensive clothes .
monday : color is powerful .
on physiological , almost impossible wear bright red pants when still mood swings frustrated .
if you happy , you will attract to other happy person .
mainstream been far higher estimation .
my life spent time , wanted to do , and myself into mainstream .
just do you yourself .
if you have the right person around , they not only will understand , they will also appreciate .
accept you 童心 .
sometimes anybody would tell me , said i like play dressed , or i reminded they they seven children .
i love smile to them , and say & quot ; thank . & quot ;
self confidence is key .
if you think you wear what funny-looking , that you must be dressed up pretty .
if you think you not wear what funny-looking , that you also almost certainly is right .
from small to large , my mom i tell this , every day
but i got 30 , to know what this is mean .
and i would for you very quickly analysis about .
if you believe you is a beautiful people , 里里外外 , no what clothes is you can not wear funny-looking .
so some of you all have no reason .
what we can just wear what wear .
thank you .
truth on friday : a pervasive - a few words give you : gold bright piece hundred literally .
finally , 星期六 : development unique personal style . was a really good way tell world who you are , a words are rather said .
it once again for i walked to prove this week when people a time times what i , just because i wear .
we undertake enjoyable conversation .
that clothes course all will not huddled into my little travel box .
so before i back brooklyn , i would put everything give back .
because this weeks i in teach themselves let go is can .
i need not about things 眷恋 , because in next corner , there will forever again a crazy , bright colors gleaming clothes set in wait i , if i with love to find .
very much .
thank you .
this is brain portray diagram .
your brain can be marks for two parts .
left brain , major responsible rational ways , and right brain , major accountable intuition .
if we use 刻度线 to measure brain 半球 ability , and tagging our brains .
for example , this represent somebody completely rational .
this means with someone completely sentimental .
that you will put your brain in line where ?
some people might choose that a , but i think most extreme situations audience , your brain position should roughly like this - two brain 半球 and have very high potential .
they not too might each other excluded or other what .
you can both rational and sentimental .
i think is a like most other experiment quantum physicist , have very good 逻辑思维 can put those complex ideas 串连 up .
but also , we need a good intuition let experiment can realistic undertake down .
so how we to improve this intuition force ? well we love research stuff .
we itself research and do is things , then we would look how it response .
we then from leverage our intuition force .
actually you also do the same thing .
have some you might nurturing for many years intuition like a things can only meanwhile appeared in a places .
i mean , this would very strange , want you to consider a things can also appeared in two different place , but you is not born just have this concept , you are acquired nurture .
i remember saw a child in 阻 car stimulators on playing .
he also was just a learn step and not at this child , he just keep fall .
but i bet and 阻 car stimulators play give him up very valuable lesson , is large objects will not let you easily through , and they stuck in a place .
this is world have a very has conceptual model , unless you is particle physicists .
for particle physicists also it will is a very bad model , because they not research 阻 car stimulators , they study those very small strange particles .
when they study their particles , they feel they in do various really weird things - like they can wear wall , or they can also appeared in two places .
they found , that they record these it and afford called quantum mechanics theory .
this is few years ago physics frontier ; you need to describe tiny , tiny particles quantum mechanics .
but you not need it to describe those huge , around everyday objects .
not that very fit i intuitions cognitive , maybe because i not too often research particles forbidden right .
well , i still have when study them , just not too normal points .
and i also never see them .
i mean , nobody can see particles .
but this also not fit i logic cognitive .
because if all things are made of particles and every particles follows quantum mechanics theory words , that all things should also follow quantum mechanics not theoretical ?
reason i not find why it not follow .
so i for whole thing will know better if we some way to quantum mechanics theory suggests daily every everything also follow .
soon before , i started .
i made this .
this is first can you of see is also product of quantum mechanics fold add .
here we see is a computer microscopic chip .
in middle that green you probably can see dots .
which is i pick down to tell metal .
this is a picture of it .
focused point . we see middle that dot .
this is basically a very close , very close distance see 金属片 .
we see a little 块金属 , it shape like a 跳水 panels , and it reached out on one .
i use almost and build 电脑芯片 same way create this metal .
i in sterile studio operate a piece 硅晶片 , then i alive in all these large machine about 100 hours .
to the end result , i had to make your machine - let this type on 60 hole in equipment down .
this device had ability to undertake fold quantum add , but it need some help to finish this steps .
to , let me give you for example .
you know how not comfortable in a crowded elevator is ?
i mean , when i a people in elevator , i can do various weird things , but when others in i stop doing these things , because i think out to other people , or , not real words , scary to other people .
so quantum mechanics suggests unquote organisms 变现 out the same situation .
those unquote organisms passengers not just people , but it still including gotten down here it light the wind in it and space in 热度 .
so , if we want to witness this piece metal exhibit the quantum mechanics properties , we will not no better displace all other passengers .
this is we ever do .
we shut light , then we put it in pull vacuum maker and pulled out all air , then we will it cooling into 绝对零 degrees more subtle .
now , in elevator , little 金属片 can do any it wanted to do .
we measure it movement .
we found it in very peculiar way in movement .
it is in vibration , not completely static .
it is like this vibration way - like a picture a mixture of 风箱 .
just to give it a mild impact , we can let it also not vibrating vibration - some only in quantum mechanics range next will happen .
i told you is here some very amazing things .
also not vibrating a things vibration what is this ?
let we consider atoms .
one example : all trillion a form 金属片 atoms are keep static but the same these atoms are and move .
only in particular accurate time , they are correspondence .
the odd time they just is not 定域 .
that means every atom in time between in two different place , further illustrate entire 金属片 location in two .
i think this really cool .
really .
i these years locked myself in sterile studio do are very worth .
because , look this , individual atoms and 金属片 proportion worst about and sea of 金属片 and you this individual proportion worst is the same .
so if individual 原子能 also in different two location , that 金属片 can also in different two position , so why you can not ?
i mean , this just i rational thinking logic .
that what would imagine if you can also in 多个位置 , that is like ?
you how cognitive will processing you itself in space 不定 域 problem ?
this is story a part .
when we put it heat , and open light observation box inside , we see 金属片 still is just a piece .
so i had to form a new intuition , seems all objects of elevator actually were thys into an extremely small space quantum object .
you heard many about quantum physics how life explain is connect of each other .
well , this is not completely right ; it wants more widely , more profound than this .
that these connection , you and your peripheral these connection , really definition of who you are .
this is quantum mechanics profound and incredible .
thank
as you know , my work is write children 读物 actually , i is american maybe most widely children 读物 author
i often tell others i not want to be as a scientist
can you put my when do a farmers , or wear 皮衣 person but nobody ever choose is farmers
i today to tell you is about cycle and epiphany
epiphany usually mean you discover you into certain situation
you need 碰壁 to find epiphany around
this is a cycle of picture
a friend of i draw - richard de 鲍林布罗克
this is very complicated i going tell you of
i cycle stem from 60 century from ohio , 斯朵 high school when i was a 捣蛋 goddamn
i is that weekly in boys housing by play to out blood that of people until a teacher put my from this life rescued . out
she put i rescued . out this life let me living in teacher 休息室 bathroom
she 悄悄的 doing her a do was do three but i leaving this town
with 特长 , and 85 dollars , eventually i 落脚 on the 圣弗朗西科 and san francisco , california - met my lover - remember to the 80s i find work started in aids organization is very necessary .
about 三四年 before i in night got a really from the teachers , 普斯顿 teacher phone she said , & quot ; i need meet you
i very disappointed we never in adults gestures understand each other
you can to then ? please bring that you find people also coming
i should mention i have - pancreas cancer but i thought please you can ignore this part
that , second day we went to cleveland city
we met her , conversation with , crying around we know she need lives into stage-three patients ayn culture being hospitalized
we find a , take her for her past care she doesn support her family because this is something we need must know how to do
is this put my as adults view want to know my girls eventually visualization became powder placed in my hands pretty of box
what happens is cycle end this was formed a cycle - i said epiphany you get self of them
this epiphany is part of death is life
she saved my life i friends and i saved her life .
that video days need that life to done & tbr ;
it needs authenticity and beautiful i happy these today be times mentioned
it also need - it need dignity love and joy
our job is to these walking open to
thank
2007 i think we need economic development of redefine we consciousness concept .
we should new goal specialize in when each family think they want to live and work place when they can have at least five different can choose competitive attract new households cities .
for this goal we have a long way to go .
in developing countries have billions of the people in no a city will open they stages .
but cities astonishing beauty is it 利用价值 than the build consumption value to more more .
so we can build few 10 for world very easy , or hundreds of new city .
you probably think this sounds really absurd if you never consider new city .
but this is only alternative city residential architecture points .
imagine half the want to live in apartment person already into live ; another half not yet into live .
you could add built already have residential to try extending area .
but you know you 经手 residential and surrounding 地块 is protected by law ensure the comfort and 娱乐性 architecture .
do these add built is very difficult .
but can you in never developed areas building a building new buildings , like 俗话说 recreate started strong seen 停滞不前 .
so i proposed government 划定 new enough quarters embodies city and goose called : charter city .
about i understand these meanwhile , 哈维尔 and president gram tower two-dimensional president are thinking in 洪都拉斯 recreate the planning problem .
allegedly about seven million 50 year 洪都拉斯人 immigrants to america they want to ask , what can they do sure can let these people stay in the same work 洪都拉斯 do , living down .
one time , 哈维尔 said to 奥克塔维奥 & quot ; if we put we vacant land - if we put it what would gifted embassy - some give u.s. embassy ; some give canada embassy - there if think in canada or american rules next local find work , they can find work , in these embassy , local area do work otherwise have to canada or american find work ? & quot ;
2009 summer 洪都拉斯 a time 铁血 military coup through .
in next 届 routine visit to my doctor elections in 佩佩 de 洛沃 won elections talk on promised reform and 和谈 earn overwhelming advantage .
he invited 奥克塔维奥 as he 参谋长 .
also , i was preparing a tedglobal on speech .
through a series of modification try wrong , user amount of test i try to this charter city complexity of compressed into the basic gist .
one is 法令 importance , as 法令 said you could not harassing households same into live already .
we attention new technology but new technology need technology and demand to execution .
usually is these demand towed we 后腿 .
in 2010 秋 , a guatemala friends sent 奥克塔维奥 this tedtalk link .
he put it show 哈维尔
they give me call
said , & quot ; let us take this show us president . & quot ;
december we went in miami through in a hotel boardroom touch sides .
i try to explain these cities value are and compared it consumption its value will have many .
i use this slide show like new york this area a piece never developed 地块 value .
notice , in some dots , 地价 to every square meters several thousand dollars .
but this is a roughly abstract discussion when some gaps 奥克塔维奥 said , & quot ; paul , maybe we can watch tedtalk .
tedtalk use simple way was 讲明 charter cities are a beginning from uninhabited quarters , charter 细化 execution rules is also people choice whether 入住 whether live in these rules down a chance .
洪都拉斯 president to the person i questions that 表态 said we need this project this is key this will is lead us forward road countries .
i was invited visit 特古西加尔巴 in january 4 , 5日 recap this project .
i show another including this slide case classes trying to tell this view , if you think in cities create tremendous value . it must also is very large .
this is 丹佛 city picture 高亮 out is 丹佛 new airport .
this airport just of land over 100 square kilometers alone .
i try to convince 洪都拉斯 president if you to build a building new city you get to in at least 1,000 square kilometers area 入手 .
this than 25 million acres still big .
everybody drum with control really have polite .
audience expressions are serious and watch out for .
conference chairman walks to go say & quot ; 罗摩 professor , very thank you lecture but maybe we can look tedtalk .
i now have on notebook . & quot ;
so i sit , they are look up tedtalk .
it also grab essence was new city brought gave people new choices .
this is a you will to city choice maybe in 洪都拉斯 and not several hundred kilometers far north .
it also gave leaders new choices .
because 洪都拉斯 government leadership need friends nation help those from 友国中 profit those help they set and practice rules to let everyone would believe charter of charter actually would get practice .
the president 洛沃 muscle is to get ability promise i think way as a attract 外商 investment build cities should and 洪都拉斯 experience years fear and suspect different parties same important .
we field research that piece areas .
this is a picture of there .
this can easily embodies thousand square kilometers .
shortly after , january 19th they in congress vote altered constitution to provide a legal support to permission specific development areas .
on just experienced coup this country congress favor constitution correction answers numerous is 124 than 1 .
social on 派系 , all parties support this correction answers .
as part of constitution , you actually need on congress through twice .
in 114 in february 17th , they than 1 again through act .
immediately in february vote after 21st to 24th about 30 people 洪都拉斯 delegation came to world two construction most interested in two places .
one is korea .
this is a picture korea will built large , new downtown - than boston science still big .
all you see just building four years . but they get permission to build spent four years .
another attract architecture is singapore .
they actually already built two new city in china and prepared built third .
if you rationally consider this that we present situation .
they have 地块 , and have consider to build it as second cities .
they are walking into a legal app to allow administration intervene also had a 外加 legal system .
a country already voluntary let supreme court to this new justice system and be eventually appeal application of court .
this is interested cities for it for designers and architects .
these can even take give them some economic support .
but one thing you understand early by solve is have many 佃户 .
have many possible intent moved into its american special moved into its to freedom transaction zone also have many people wanted to go there .
worldwide , there 7亿 people want to immediately permanent migration that certain other places .
every year 100 million people from latin america to america .
and many is away from family to find work father - sometimes is 单亲 mom to money for 衣食 livelihoods .
sadly is , sometimes even is kids trying for and long never see parents sometimes , many decades , they only reunited with .
this is a how the vision to consider in 洪都拉斯 build a new city ?
or build dozen a new city or worldwide build a hundred new city ?
this is a how the vision to consider again insisted every family had count a have 竞争力 attract new households city choice ?
this is a worth spreading view .
i 洪都拉斯 friends let me sound thank , ted .
as an artist , connection to me is very important .
through i work of art i try articulating human not with nature 分隔开 but every one thing is connect of each other .
i first went to antarctica about 10 years ago , i also first saw iceberg .
i feel awe .
my heart quickly phwap move , 头晕目眩 , try to understand what this is in front of me .
in i around iceberg floating out water almost 200 feet .
i can only feel very strange this is a piece snowflake covers in another of snowflake , decade after decade form .
iceberg form is when they from glaciers breaking open or breaking from the ice shelf open .
every iceberg are they own unique personality .
they 与其 peripheral environment and the situation interactive has a vivid way .
some iceberg reject compromise stayed , and other iceberg just not to endure in point radical passion 喷涌 next just water 崩 ice when .
when you see iceberg , quite easily thought they are isolated , they are independent , solo held together , is more like we human sometimes for itself view .
but reality beyond this .
as iceberg melt , i breathe to it ancient odor .
as iceberg melts , it released rich minerals umami water they feeds things .
i started photographing these iceberg if i in film i ancestors portrait , to know in these individual moment when iceberg is at that way but never fantastic like that exist .
when they melt , this is not death ; also is not a end , but the a continuation to 生生不息 path .
i photographed iceberg , some ice is very young - thousands age .
some ice over 100,000 years .
i want to show you last picture is taken i on greenland kekertsuatsiak a iceberg .
this is a very it opportunity you really rare actually to witness a iceberg 翻滚 .
so this what diagram like precursors .
on the left you can see a little ship .
this is a about 15 feet boat .
i want you to notice iceberg shape it on the water , deformed .
here you see it started 翻滚 , boat move to the side , a man standing in there .
this is a average size greenland iceberg .
it floating out water is about 120 feet high or 40 meters tall .
this video is taken real-time .
like this iceberg , they show you are the personality different ways .
thank you .
i hope you imagine two couple in years 1979 at the same day , same moment every for with a child - good
so two couple are 都都 with a child
now , i hope you spend too much time to not imagine pregnant because if you spend too much time to think it you would not heard i say .
so slightly good just think about .
so in this case i to imagine , a example is carrying y chromosomes sperm met carrying x chromosome egg .
another is carrying x chromosome sperm met carrying x chromosome egg .
two all save survive , two all started developmental
we then look at this two couple
i was two role in what i did field
a role is i do anatomy history study
what i was a 史学 workers i study is human is how treat anatomy - for whether human torso , or animals torso - how they processing bodily fluids , abstract torso how they is view torso of
another role is a fighter social activists as a role for patients 辩护人 - or said , like i sometimes said , as doctors patients 辩护人 - i are very radical .
that way , in what in my work to touch is some challenge with social norms people
like , i access to some people is 连体 babies two people share used a body
and some are dwarves disorder patient they than general people to little more
another , many people i contact their gender differently - that they no very standard men characteristics or women specialized body characteristics
overall , this symptoms can be called double sexual people
double sexual can have multiple form
i to a few examples to illustrate you can have both not is standard men characteristics also not is standard women characteristics type
a people can have xy chromosomes and , one example of sry gene speaking males gender decided genes on y chromosomes looking after stimulation we in fetus period all have original 性腺 make it into testes
so in fetus period , testes secrete testes hormones
but this individual lack receptor to harvest testes hormones body can not respond to testes hormones
this is a species called testes not sensitive and testes now syndrome
so , testes hormones amount big , but can not cause reaction
so , body will toward now trend development
when babies born , she looks like a girls
she is girls , and be considered 小姑娘 to raise
most situation , until adolescence her chest started developmental when she no woman 性周期 then we will start to suspect have what errors
so they check that her not ovaries womb and actually , in her body have testes , and she carrying y chromosomes
now , have an important question need illustrate is you think this person is actually a man girls actually not necessarily
women , same body and men have a organ called 肾上腺
it in our body later end
and 肾上腺 responsible secrete male 性激素 which a male hormone
like me most women - i believe i themselves a typical women - i actually not too clear i chromosomes mashed but i think i should is a typical of women - most women like i actually is male hormone sensitive of
we secrete testosterone , and reaction to it has
result is , it like me women , brain revealing in much testosterone next than the born have testes girl the testosterone not sensitive syndrome girl have testosterone more
so say gender is a very complicated things ; is not said those double sexual person is in between men and women - in some ways , they can cover the whole sexual characteristics range
another example few years ago , i received a 19th year-old boy play to phone he raw down is a boy , also be as boy to have then have girlfriend , also and girlfriend happened sex always through boy lives but recently , he discovered body have ovaries womb and
all his is a very extreme symptoms called steroids 21- 羟 visualization enzymes deficit disorder
he carrying ? chromosomes and within womb when he 肾上腺 very active and formed a male hormone environment
result is , he developmental men reproductive organs his brain accept the more men typical hormone
so he birth next to look like a man girls - fundamental nobody suspect
only when he long to 19 years old when he started met physiological problem is actually in body appear menstrual afford doctors found , actually he inside is women
good , we come quickly see a example another may bring gender characteristics situation
have ? chromosomes some people will develop a called eggs 睾 organ is when ovaries organization also be testes organization 包裹 up a organs
we can not sure it 成因
so say gender can is not defined in one form
have these body characteristics kids - either dwarves disorder , or 连体 babies or type is double sex - often been surgeon surgery righted reason actually is not for body health
because many cases , they body actually all very healthy
they accept various surgery reason is because they are we society on threats to people compartmentalized
or said social world already have a typical recognize what body structure , have what feature
so , we concepts is as a woman are must women features and so on , a body of black get iconic africa people 结构特征 in your 履历
so we have this too simple understanding of
when we faced a certain aspect is different body who can not categorize of ideas surprising to we feel
so our culture has many naive idea is about individualism of
and we countries based on a very not actually individualism concept .
ok , you can imagine how astonishing that when you two kids birth is in a body of
i recently a time met this case is last year , africa track athletes , 卡斯特尔 de thys door he in berlin international competition by questioned gender problems
many interviewer call me , ask me & quot ; they would use which 检测方法 to prove to you 卡斯特尔 de 塞门亚 is man or woman ? & quot ;
so i had to explain to they said , had no detect way
fact , we now know gender already is very complicated we to admit nature no a clear nation to distinguish or men and double sex and women and men or women double sexual this line of those is actually ourselves we draw
so we now case is science the development as we admit these gender breakdown form what we think very course body structure is learn compartmentalized on too simple to give properties marks categories the actually situation than we imagine fuzzy more
and this was not about gender questions
also is questions about race this is not intricacy far we academic language can describe the
as we can see , we involving various difficult field
we to look a example , reality case is we use 95 percent human dna with gorilla do contrast
drake fact is human and gorilla dna just on some the letters acid was
technology the development as we will involving to let people struggle field we must admit those still continues simple breakdown is too simplicity .
this is why , we are looked at all of human life field
one field culture , one example is we field , culture area of america today hot 议 with life origins and end
we have a difficult discussion about from when we what one body became a human and have different from fetus rights
we have a very controversial topic - maybe in today external not within medical arguing boldly - is about whenever predicts for people death question
past , people die when our ancestors never will ever more struggling to this
the more is put a feather stick in person nose next if feather move , 旁人 would not put they buried off
if feather not move , will buried their
but today situation is all we hope take dead transplant organs to other people body on
results we started struggling on top mentioned in the problem about what dead not
this cause us into a very difficult situation this situation no before simple categorize .
now you might think , all of these are collapsed categorize may make people like me happy
i was a on political opinions constantly progress people , i maintain the body unlike in 常人 person but i must admit , this change let me nervous
learn these categorize institutions than we imagine still not stability , make i feel nervous
meanwhile , i nervous from democratic view
so , to tell you this nervous levels i first to admit , i & 国父 the biggest fan
i know they was , they the racism was but they the men from activism very great
i mean , they are so these strong , heroic , fearless and positive doing their career i ourselves every few years just to recreate to appreciate the pretty the 音乐剧 & quot ; 1776 and america 建国 history 音乐剧 is not because music , good music is can be completely ignored .
was they happening the because 1776年 around 建国
建国 policemen are , i think they is the earliest anatomy activists this is why i love them .
they against a concept of anatomy and use another instead this new into beautiful concept keep 200 years
you recall of we 建国 policemen they against is a concept of 君主 institutions
and on this 君主制 is based on too simplicity anatomy concept of
old rules next 帝王 are not dna notion but they following is & quot ; is born ideas
they have privileged concept
they think , body in political power next person is should mastery power because privileged origin from grandfather to father to son one generation channeling
建国 policemen they use a new anatomic against this view they on concept instead that is everybody equality
they disappear grades ideas and sure anatomy importance is using this equality and is not is born dignity
in was that was a really radical reform
a way , this reform still going on because they is part of enlightenment system of development two things is common
democracy in form was are but technology also in development
pretty obvious is , if you notice about the history of the 建国 many of them are very interested in science and they all very interested in naturalism world this concept
they dismiss supernatural argument they excluded those about supernatural power argument because supernatural power concept being spread is based on very fuzzy 身世 idea
they advocating naturalism concept
if you look will discover , for example in independent proclamation they mention to nature and natural the god
they no mentioned god and god natural
they mentioned natural power to explain who we are
of that as part of they for we bring a concept that is everybody born equality
legitimacy they really for future civil rights movement 铺垫 a very beautiful road
they want not to how will future , but they 奠定 basis , this is very great for us
so count years later what happened ?
like what happened in women member all their crave voting rights scaled the 建国 concept everybody equality far important than people is born they said : & quot ; we have womb and ovaries fact these different completely not necessarily means we no vote no fully citizens rights no private property rights etc & quot ;
women proposition got good
next is how successful in the civil rights movement movement appears people like 索杰纳 de 特鲁思 she quote is not & quot ; i woman ? & quot ;
we know men once there was on civil rights movement development route sentence quote & quot ; i was a men & quot ;
moreover , color crowd appealed to everybody equality and should not 种族歧视 secondly ,
we see the same success case happen in 伤残 people rights movement
question is , course when we started to rethink all citizens we have to start question why we to maintain a fixed the boundary
now , to remind you is , i hope to keep some boundaries body structure on , within our culture range by
for example , i hope not give fish and human same rights
i hope we not give up everything in anatomically distinguish boundaries
i hope , not a five year-old children can be allowed have sex or say allowed married
so say , have some on anatomy boundaries for us is meaningful , i think those should be preserve
but , huge task is try to find out what is should keep why we to preserve them , they have what meaning
so , let we back said to the two people are what talk a started fictional that two people
we have two couple are in 1979 years on the pregnant .
let we imagine , mary having three months born . so she born in 1980 june 1日
henry , contrary , foot month birth he born in 1980 march 1日
just because mary early born three months this fact she get various rights time to 比亨利 early three months allow have sex rights elections rights , drinking rights
henry not it to not waiting he physiology age without any different just because he born time different
we also found some other 离奇 rights problem
henry , because by assume for men - though i never told big home he is type xy chromosomes - due was presumption for men so now going 应征 入伍 mary not need to worry these
meanwhile , mary can not in all the states like henry enjoy same rights is , married rights
henry can in any a states married but mary now can only in few states marry a woman
so what we insisted some structure of the biological categorize them in many ways is have problem and need questioned of
for me , the problem just becomes : we what to do when we science in anatomy on so advanced we already to to admit based on the anatomy people democracy maybe is in collapsed when
i want for science losing hope but also , sometimes not sort of think science development is by we impact
so where we are running ?
looks we society with a utilitarian attitudes : & quot ; better , i must draw one boundaries , then i in somewhere in that draw one boundaries & quot ;
but many people would so sucked in a very awkward position
an example texas have a decided she marry a man means you have no y chromosomes , and if you marry a woman means you have y chromosomes
in reality , they actually will not to detect chromosomes
but this very strange because i also a started told you that story about male hormone not sensitive syndrome
as has we look modern democracy dr. martin luther king one 奠基人 in his & quot ; i have a dream & quot ; talk , for we provide an solutions
he thought we & quot ; should not by a people color but should based on his 品格 & quot ; to justify a people dismiss 人种 differences
i want to say & quot ; yes , that sounds really is a good way
but actually operate in , you how to do ?
how you by his 品德 to justify he ?
i also want to point out i not so sure how we should assigned human rights because , i must admit , some gold 猎犬 than i know some people seems more should get society help
i want to say , i know some 拉布拉多 seems than some about 40 people on sex question more of , more smarter , more can make mature decided
so we how to measure 品德 question ?
results prove is very difficult of
i also want to know if 品德 好坏 in future can be scan out - maybe can use mri see ?
we really will walk to that a step ?
i not sure where we are running
i know is should think what american lead democracy problems looks is very important .
we on for democracy problem already done very well i think next same will do better
we circumstances and iran different , a men in sexual ways for other men have traction is so he can killed unless he will change their sexual approaches so can he will survive
we no that situation
i very happy said we no that situation - said to a woman surgeon , that was in several years before he bring a 连体 baby hope can help they separate , some extent also want ourselves famous
but when i telephone call with him asked him why do this surgery hope - because this is a very high dangers surgery - he said , in this country this kids will be crude treat , so he had to help they doing
i to his answer is , & quot ; well , you consider for them through political 避难 not is do surgery ? & quot ;
american keep for like this kids they own signature provide very big might they from not use for national change its body
so i think we should to lead this ideas
ok , said to here , i want to remind you i already talk a lot 前人 .
i also want to think about democracy would like what , or is what already is like possibilities if we can engage more mother
i also want to say to feminist a little radical words that i think people different maybe can bring different of observation perspective especially when we used 体性 thinking group
i already for double sexual people interested many years also to gender differences also did years of studies
i very interested things one is to observe the worldwide in thinking problem and solve between men and women difference
we knew from cross-cultural research of women , average look - of course not everybody , but average look - more tend to notice complex social relationships are also more care and compassion disadvantaged of crowd
so if we think we found a interesting situation
count years ago , when i read graduate i one of guidance professor know feminist movement very interested me - i since tendency is feminist , is always - he asked me a very blame question
he said : & quot ; tell i feminism now where
i thought & quot ; well ... this is the most let i 哑 bite 无言 problem i heard
feminism is all eradicate 陈腐 gender ideas of everything activity s , so , not exist feminism now & quot ;
but , further read this question , i think , is more maybe feminist there some now
namely , maybe some , 总的说来 women thinking different from men part allow more rich 警惕性 for complex social relationships are and more notice we care those disadvantaged
but ago people mindfulness point out how protect personal not country impact if we in this concept injecting as more 母性 are possible we will have to far more than a concept not how protect but how care each other
maybe this is our future to walk of when we now 人种 separately to tell democracy - also is less consider to people individuals identity properties about people , but more consider the relationship between people
so , when people trying to create a better 联合体 what we need consider is we for somebody all do
thank
imagine a big bang when you in 3,000 more 呎 .
imagine within cage with black smoke
imagine engine emits clicks conclusion , clicks conclusion , clicks conclusion , clicks conclusion , clicks sounds conclusion of -
sounds this - very scary
day i position very particular , i sat in 1d
i only can and empty suit gang people talking is
so i look at them they say & quot ; no problem , we should just hit on bird . & quot ;
机长 already turn 机头 towards we from destination very close
already can see manhattan .
two minutes later three thing also happened
机长 put airplane 对齐 ha germany going river
typically lane are not so
he closed engine
imagine a computer there sound airplanes
and he said a few words i heard most not take emotion of a few words
he said & quot ; are 迫降 , careful shock
i without ask empty suit gang what anymore .
i can see from her glances fear life ended
now i want to share with you three thing day what i learned
moments within everything changed
we goal in life list those we wanted to do all those people i think linked 络 no linked 络 those i should tinkering fence , relationships all things i want experience no experience
after i remember those thing i want to a phrase that is & quot ; i collection wine are very bad
because if wine has mature , object also had , i way 把酒 opened
i want to not put anything 延 later
this 急迫 purpose sexual changed my life
what i learned second thing is due we by george washington bridge goes that also no before long i thought , wow i only have a really regret thing
although i made some wrong
but i life actually good i try put every things do better
but because human i self something re center
i regret was spent many time and important people talk of those not important things in life
i thought my relationship with wife , and friends and people
after , i remember this thing i decided get rid of my life negative emotions
no completely do yet , but good .
past two years i never and wife 吵架
feeling great
i stopped try debate for wrong i choice happiness
third thing what i learned when you brain to calculate backwards clock & quot ; 15 , 14 , 13
see next water level started rising
thought quot ; bloody bang . & quot ;
i thought shattered this thing into 20 piece not like documentaries in
when we gradually sink i suddenly feel , wow die not terrible
is like we always in do prepared for that
but very sad
not want to just leave , i love my life i
this sad main source is i just expect a thing
i hope i can see my kids grew
after a month , i join daughter performance - she year grade , nothing art gifted ⋯ ⋯
⋯ ⋯ even so
i tears like a child
let my world recreate have meaning
was i realized attach this two events on actually i only important thing is become a good father life
the only goal than any things are important my life is made a good father
day i went through a god 迹 i survive .
and i get another revelation like s see own future back change their life
i encourage today want sit airplane you imagine 若是 same happening in on you - hopefully not - but think like , how would you change ?
have what is because you want to do without do you think you have other opportunity do it ?
how would you change your relationships no longer so negative ?
most important is , whether you try be a good parents ?
thank you .
the net computers worms behind ideas actually simple .
we hope not iran have nuclear weapons .
they use in developed nuclear weapons main device is 纳坦兹 uranium facilities reduced .
you see 灰 box is real-time control system .
if we manage tick , these 控制驱动器 speed and valves system , we can actually use a centrifuge causes many problem .
this 灰 box can not run windows software ; they use is completely different technology .
but if we manage put a windows viruses to a device engineer allocation for this 灰 box notebook on , we can then start acting .
this is the net virus behind conspiracy .
so i started a windows injecting stimulators .
it carry virus from mother to 灰 box , a centrifuge , iran nuclear destruction project delay - mission accomplished .
very easy , right ?
i want to tell you how is we found these .
when we started studying the net virus six months ago , we the purpose of know nothing about it .
only know is , it windows parts , injecting stimulators very , very complicated , use multiple 零日 exploit attacks .
it seems want what do to these 灰 box , these real-time control system .
this cause we notice , we launched a lab project , use the net virus we world system , and did carefully examine .
then some very interesting things happened .
the net virus performance like not like cheese big only white sniffing sniffing rats - a cheese , but not to eat .
i some not understand .
and after we experiment of different cheese , i realized , this is a targeted attacks .
it is completely targeted .
if find certain allocation , injecting stimulators will active dive 灰 box , even it are trying to infection actual app also doing the same thing .
if not find goal , the net virus do nothing .
this actually cause i notice , we started study the for this day and night not stop , because i think we still not know it goal ? .
goal is maybe , for example , a building american plant , or germany chemical .
so we best quickly find out it goal .
we extract and 反编译 attack code , found it contains two numbers bombs - a smaller and a bigger .
and we also found , they are being understand all 内幕 information people very professional to make out .
they understand all to attack goal detail .
they even know since shoes number .
they know everything .
if you ever heard of , the net virus injecting stimulators complicated and is high technology , let me tell you : it carry virus very complicated .
this far than we ever seen technology .
here you can see actually attack code clip .
we in discussion - about 15,000 okay code .
looks like 旧式 汇编语言 .
i want to tell you how were we figure out these code .
we first function to find is system up , because we know what these function do .
and we need to find 定时器 data structure , then try connect they and real world - connected with potentially reality world goal .
so we need goal theory we can use it to assert or .
to get theory , we remember this absolute would cause goal severe destruction , so inevitable have a higher value goal , and probably is in iran , because in iran report virus most world more .
in many goal a region would not discovered this .
basically can put goal shrinking to 布歇赫尔 核电厂 and 纳坦兹 uranium factory reduced .
so i said to my assistant , & quot ; give me a contain all a centrifuge and plant of our 客户群 experts lists . & quot ;
i really with them phone , let them use their professional knowledge help analysis we found in the code and data .
this very work .
we can put this small number 弹头 connected to 转子 micro-controller .
this 转子 is a centrifuge inside movement 机件 , is you see the black object .
if control this 转子 speed , actually can decoding 转子 and can eventually even let a centrifuge bang .
we also see attack purpose is make this everything terrifying things slow to happen - obviously this will bring maintaining engineers m crazy , they probably not very quickly find out problem .
large numbers 弹头 - by closely at data and data structures , we have opportunity for anything about it .
for example , digital 164 in these code very compelling ; not might ignore it .
i started study and how these 分离机 discovered by build in 纳坦兹 about science literature , and they were the things of organization in a called relate , each relate contains 164 a a centrifuge .
this a little clear , the match up .
even better match .
in iran these a centrifuge is divided into 15 a so-called 机组 .
guess what we found in the attacks code ?
a almost exactly the same 机组 structure .
so , once again matches up really well .
this on what we do work gave us more confidence .
now don misunderstanding i , it is not like this of ongoing .
these results contains the us several weeks hard labor .
we often go into 死胡同 and back starting point .
anyway , we find out this two from different directions target with same goal number 弹头 .
little 弹头 choose a relate , spinning faster 转子 , then let they slow down , and big 弹头 choices six relate and manipulate valves .
overall , what we sure goal is we very confident .
is 纳坦兹 , may just be 纳坦兹 .
virus we not fear other might be the net to attack goal .
some we see very cool stuff - does make i mind things .
underneath is 灰 box , in top see here is a centrifuge .
things is this , it head off from sensors send to input worth - for example , from pressure sensor and vibration sensors input worth - and provide legal code , this code will during the attack still stay running , along code together have fake input data .
in fact , this fake input data is the net virus advance predict save .
as robbed clip of hollywood movie , observing camera by linked in the advance recorded good video .
cool , is not ?
it going obviously not only is to stupid since of control room .
it actually want more dangerous , more organized aggressive .
it intend to is to around numbers safe system .
we need digital security system in the human since can not make fast enough action places .
for example , in plant , when huge steam 轮机 转速 before fast when , must in open 安全阀 within a milliseconds .
obviously , human since not possible .
so , here need digital safe system .
and when they by damage , really problems will appear .
plant will bang .
since and safe system all will not notice .
this is terrible .
but will also worse .
i going said , very important .
think about this .
this attack is universal .
it not need for a centrifuge , for uranium do what reduced specific thing .
it also will play role , for example , in a plant or a car 制造厂 .
this normal .
as a fighter 攻击者 , you need - not not use model u for disk put virus spread out , as we in the net virus this a case see that .
you can also transmitted with traditional worms technology .
as loosely spread it .
if do these eventually would have a mass destruction web weapons .
this is we have to confront consequences .
unfortunately , goal is not in this kind of attacks number most more middle east .
but in american , europe and japan .
all these green area , these is goal dense area .
we have to confront these consequences , our best immediately started doing preparation .
thank you .
chris anderson : i have a problem .
拉尔夫 , widely out people think 摩萨德 is back 主使 .
you look how ?
拉尔夫 de 兰纳 : okay , you really want to know ?
yes , ok .
i think 摩萨德 there , but dominate power is not israel . them
其后 dominate power is networks superpower .
just have a that america - very lucky , very lucky .
because otherwise did , we face problem that more severe .
chris : thank you scared us a big jump , thank you , 拉尔夫 .
i once had involved in life many amazing project .
but done most cool project related to this guy .
they 伙 name is tempt .
one of tempt is the original 1980s graffiti artist .
one day he ran step back home said , & quot ; daddy , i 发麻 something legs . & quot ;
this is als early symptoms .
tempt now completely paralyzed .
only his eyes can activity .
i ever contact with he .
i have home do design and animation company , obviously doodling is we in art world look up to and respected a complicated part .
so , we decided to become tony , is tempt , career sponsor .
so i to find he brothers and his father said to them , & quot ; we intend to give you some money .
you will use to do ? & quot ;
he brothers said , & quot ; i just wanted can again and tony chat .
i just wanted to can communicate with him and he can with my communicate . & quot ;
i said , & quot ; etc , i have seen , stephen hawking , & quot ; is not all paralyzed of people could communicate through these devices and others ?
he said , & quot ; no , unless is top social people , & quot ; have very amazing health frontal , otherwise fundamental to do not .
these devices is not so easily get . & quot ;
i said , & quot ; okay , you how is communicate ? & quot ;
you have no seen movie & quot ; diving minutes and butterflies ?
that is way they communicate - moving their fingers .
i said , & quot ; this 法子 too backward . how could that be ?
when i appeared wish just opened check , instead , i open slide i completely not know how true check .
i was promised he brothers and his father - 大意 is , & quot ; okay , well : tony will can speech , we would give him a machine , we will find out a can let him again creative way .
because a people intrinsic still normal can not communicate was so absurd . & quot ;
few months after i have a talk on a conference .
i met these called grl guy , doodling research lab and graffiti research was , they have an technology can let they put a beam 光投射 to any surface , and use a 激光笔 on paint , this will form a gap dark .
they show art was moving , like this around .
all these things , they call a life cycle .
first in 性器官 started , then is 脏话 , then is tilonia . bush then people see the art .
but they show always 内涵 a life cycle .
i back home with my wife had dinner , put these told her , 大意 is , & quot ; etc , if we know this technology can let you use eyes control things , why we not to a ways to control a beam laser , let tempt this a he was could undertake doodling again , which is great . & quot ;
so we started action .
about two years later , after year , in through many organizations and some situation we done some things we change .
first , we 捣毁 insurance companies door , we really give tempt a machine make he can communicate - a , stephen hawking guilt machine .
that was great .
he really is most interesting people - i called 他尤达 , because you tell him words , he send you email , hi like think , & quot ; no . i this guy too job . & quot ;
we do another thing is , we clusters seven from famous worldwide of programmers - literally , they from world every corner - take they come together we here .
my wife and children and i moved to behind garage , these hackers , programmers , conspiracy an adventist and shortly our house the 无政府主义 .
we many friends think we do really too stupid wait we house when hangs wall back images all be take down , and will be wall draw all up .
but after two weeks later , we do two weeks later , we went venice street , my children also involved , my dog involved , we make this .
we call glances 书写器 and eyewriter , you can see this demonstrate .
this is vice cheap sunglasses on we in venice waterfront road buy , some 铜线 and some from home to 宝 and line at radio shack to and sold appliances with buy things .
we got a ps3 camera , to take the it , put it apart install on a led light , now this device is free - can make myself , we put free open source yards , you can download .
now we can completely not limitations to make this a device .
no insurance companies can said no .
no any hospital can said no .
any paralysis people now can only use their eyes can paintings and communicate .
thank you .
very thank you . this great .
in two weeks end later , we back tempt room .
i love this picture , because this is others room this is his room .
all these crowded 喧嚷 is to this a significant moment .
in over year plan , two weeks programming , fast food and 通宵 meeting after , tony in seventh later first started painting .
this is a picture of amazing , because this is his life support system , he in carefully his life support system .
we shook it up his bed , let he can see .
we shelf up a projector , just in his hospital outside the parking side wall .
he again started painting , before his family and friends in parking what feeling the is - you can imagine .
interesting is , we also to huddled into parking , that like we feel we also is part of whole doodling work .
in this end when , he sent we an email , them wrote this : & quot ; this is my seventh to i first could paintings .
i think i always pushes by in underwater , and finally somebody extend hand put my head pulled water , that i could breathe . & quot ;
this is great , right .
this is a bit like we battle slogan .
is these let we keep going constantly development .
we walked so long way to do that .
this was a great equipment , but it with sketchy 刻蚀 different .
a have people should get this kind of art potential more .
we also in the process of exploration , explore how let it better , more faster , more powerful .
from then on , we by various ascent .
we won the many reward .
remember , it is free ; we nobody in use this thing made a penny .
all the spending is we since 掏腰包 .
we reward is basically , & quot ; oh , this too not afford . & quot ;
lance throve about our twitter , then in december , era magazine give we 2010 50 large invention of glorious , this really cool .
most cool thing is - this will do whole cycle - in this year april , in downtown l.a. the 芬 contemporary 艺术馆 , will have a called street art & quot ; 展览会 .
and & quot ; street art will have many street art - the 坏蛋 classes 克斯 , 谢帕德 de 费尔雷 , caw - all these people are going to debate .
tempt also will appear in fair will , this very great .
so basically my idea is : if you see some not impossible , let it be possible .
all happened in this room is impossible - this stage , this computer , this mike , this glances 书写器 - a degrees all is not possible .
everybody in this room make it is possible .
i is not programmers , also never do any associated with eye movie movement recognize technology thing , but i just wanted to something and put i connect ourselves with some amazing people this a we can whole out dots 名堂 .
i is want everybody in every , in a day when to some you think should done things , should all ask ourselves problem .
if not do now , that whenever do ? if i do not , that who to do ?
thank you .
i just from a communal back they cope with human survival secret .
doing in this community , women dominate everything , love is play sound said something to , play is all day 法宝 - happiness play is a 正经 serious thing .
not is , this not mean desire fire burn of men also not mean san francisco and which means multicultural .
ladies and gentlemen , meet you close .
this is wild 倭 chimpanzees world 座落 in congo of jungle .
倭 chimpanzees and chimpanzees is we you life in the correlates close .
we all capacity that meant a common ancestors , a evolution the grandmother , she lived in about 6百 million years ago .
now , chimpanzees meme their 好战 and 闻名于世 .
but unfortunately , we already too emphasize this ways in human evolution history the role of .
but 倭 chimpanzees shows give us is this coins other side .
when chimpanzees by again big again scary male chimpanzees 统领 , 倭 chimpanzees community is by female 倭 chimpanzees what leadership .
these 倭 chimpanzees to 相安无事 live together , leading formed a highly subsumption sexual social in this community , fatal violence behavior is not yet see .
but unfortunately , 倭 chimpanzees is hominid in most difficult by understand one .
they live in congo jungle deep , so about they research is very difficult .
congo is a 似是而非 contradiction body - she is a piece of incubation remarkable biodiversity and heart beautiful land , but she itself is also darkness - violence conflict scene already sustainable decades this taken away many life just like the first world war .
不足为奇 is , it also 危及 destruction 倭 chimpanzees survival .
looking hunting , meat sold and jungle disappear means we just give in world only save 倭 chimpanzees are provide a small habitat - be honest , we can not even sure whether would have a little habitat .
however , in this full violence and chaos land you can hear 隐隐约约 laughter 摇曳 in trees .
what animals is these close ?
we know they & quot ; make love , not to war & quot ; hominid , so they have frequently , very casual sex and double sex sex to handle conflict and solve social problems .
i now is not say this is solve all human questions way - because play than desire pass mean for 倭 chimpanzees more .
倭 chimpanzees like human , in their entire life all love play optimistic .
play is not just kids game .
for us human and 倭 chimpanzees , play is based intimacy and nurture 容忍性 .
it also let we learned trust and games rules
play a euphoric creativity and adapt force , it is all produce about diversity - diversity interactions , diversity behavior , and diversity connection .
when you see 倭 chimpanzees play , you will see very evolutionary roots about human laughter , dancing and rituals .
play is 粘结 doses makes we connected together .
now i despite not know how you is play , but i want to show you two clip just from field taken to special editing .
first , this is a 倭 chimpanzees guilt 球类 game - i not mean football .
here , two young a female a male 倭 chimpanzees in play chasing game .
look what she was doing .
this probably was phrases & quot ; she evolution in with his 蛋蛋 . & quot ; origins .
i just thought he fairly like way , right .
yes .
so sexual game in 倭 chimpanzees and human both member are 司空见惯 .
this video really interesting because it prove - this really interesting because it prove the brought unusual factor into game what creates creative - like testes - how can game seeking trust and nurture trust - meanwhile fun infinite again .
but play is a deformed process .
play is a deformed process , it can become many play games , some game is the quiet , imaginative , human of 求索 - maybe this play amazing is find new .
i want you to look , this is of cool , a young female 倭 chimpanzees , she is 悄然 to play water .
i think , like she , we sometimes play alone , we explore with inside us and we external world boundaries .
is play novelty drives us to explore , drives us to interactive connection .
and what we form this unexpected 温床 connect is really incubation creativity .
so these is only shallow drinking points by 倭 chimpanzees bringing us this deep insights to explore our past and now .
but they also for our future health have a secret , in future we need adapt a increased world full of aggressive through unprecedented creative and more collaboration to do .
this secret is play is has these ability key .
in other words , play is we adapt future empowering cards .
to successfully adapt a world of change , we need play .
but we want to trying to playfulness play ?
not 无足轻重 play ; play is critical .
for 倭 chimpanzees and human same , life is not just an teeth and other regarding 爪 .
if most for not to play , when , but it probably is most desperately need play .
so , i primates sibling are , let we embrace this talents evolution gift let together we playfulness play , by which we rediscover creativity , 情同手足 relationships and miracle .
thank you .
i want you now imagine a sterile wear robot , provide you superman ll ability , or let it can - wheelchairs users up again walking .
we call these robots 外骨骼 in berkeley technology biomimicry company .
also no other anything you morning wear later it will provide you extra power , it will 进一步提高 your speed , it will help you , like , control balance .
actually it really integrate the people and machine .
but moreover - it would integration and put you connecting with outward , connected to on other device .
this was not some 天马行空 imagine .
to show you what we currently going on work , we to talk about american soldiers , they can back on back about 100 pounds of weight , and also in was ask carrying more equipment .
obviously , this causes some 并发 questions - 30 percent soldiers had back injury chronic back injury .
so we think we should face it a challenge create a can help solve this issue 外骨骼 .
so now let me introduce thing about hulc - it is human carry 外骨骼 weight to you .
soldiers : use hulc 外骨骼 later , i thing can carry 200 pounds weight . in complex terrain walking more hours .
it flexible design can let people deep 蹲 , 匍匐 forward and high flexibility movement .
what i wanted to do it can feel , think on where to , then leverage i power and 耐力 .
艾瑟 de 本德 : we with our industry partner and ready introducing this a device , in this past introducing a new 外骨骼 .
this is really .
now let we put view towards - wheelchairs users , this is my personal very loved part .
world estimate have 6千8百 million - wheelchairs users .
about 总数 population of one .
this is a conservative estimate .
we now to say is , have spinal cord injury very young people in 年富力强 time - 20 , 30 , 40 year-old - touch wall - wheelchairs as the only choice .
and population aging also makes it a digital exponential growth .
and on this only choice , roughly - when people with stroke or other diseases - is - wheelchairs .
actually recently 500 years all is this , this is very successful introduction , i must say .
so , i think we should start write mobility new next chapter .
now let me introduce elegs to you , wear policemen is amanda de 波斯特 , she first 19 years ago by the spine damage , leading cause she first 19 years to unable walking , until now .
amanda de 波斯特 : thank .
was mean rather : i said , amanda wearing is we elegs .
it have sensors -
in these support completely are tick sensors , they 发送信号 to install in her back 机载 computer .
also have a 电池组 , provide load in her - how should i say it ? - it motors energy , including she 膝关节 motors , can it let her around in smooth natural pace forward .
the most peak of amanda : i age 24 in life , when i speed down ski 不慎 crashes poured , i paralysis .
in that moment , i lost pelvis below all feeling and activity ability .
soon after , a doctor walked into my ward , said to me , & quot ; walk amanda , you could never . & quot ;
it was first 19 years ago .
he deprive i exist every hope .
since adapt technology once make i to again learn how speed down ski , climbing , even 手动 bicycle .
but no what invented can let me walking , until now .
thank you .
was mean rather : as you can see , we have the technology , we have can sit platform , this already and you about before .
it in our hands , we have all potential , to change our offspring life - not just for soldiers , or was for amanda and all - wheelchairs users , but for everybody .
amanda : thank .
