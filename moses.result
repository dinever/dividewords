in the last few years i asked myself in both hard , and some danger . 
i went to prison -- tough 
i worked in a coal -- dangerous . 
i photographed in war zones film -- both hard and dangerous . 
i was in 30十 days just eat this kind of food -- a very interesting to start the middle , a little bit difficult , and finally , it &apos;s quite dangerous . 
in fact , most of my career i &apos;ve been to time in the case of its purpose is by being more attractive , more interesting way to study social problems want to put these problems in the form of entertainment in front of an audience . 
so , when i knew about the brand here to do with the ted i realized that i want to play a little bit of a new pattern . 
you who &apos;ve heard about a few weeks ago , i had an ad on ebay 
on facebook and twitter and sent some information i asked people have the opportunity to buy my ted 冠名 2011 . 
yes , some lucky personal or company , profit or nonprofit &apos;ll get a continuum of the only opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson not going to allow that to happen -- to buy the second time you &apos;re watching this session 冠名 the power of this session , no , don &apos;t know how many things didn &apos;t give any subject to the clue . 
so what you get is : you really here : you to my ted talk about the theme , and i finally decided whether it would be if i make you and expensive shameless company , and the possibilities that big . 
but anyway , this is a wonderful opportunity ads . 
you know how many people watch a tedtalk ? 
people . 
incidentally , this is just the 暂定 headlines . 
although to argue that i believe that would someone to buy 冠名 
if you ask me a year ago i don &apos;t like 理直气壮 now 
but , in the process i was a new project , which is my new film we wanted to marketing , a meddling with advertising 
and as i said earlier , that a few years , i always made in terrible situation , but with this of the but i was the best misery i tasted it &apos;s also a reflection of the most dangerous experience with those people in a room . 
you see , i had this idea of a movie . 
john locke systematized 摩根·斯普尔 narrator : i want to make a film about marketing in advertising , and the film , and 广告宣传 funding from the ad , marketing , and 广告宣传 
the name of this film to 卖座 定为 &quot; the movie &quot; 
&quot; the most 卖座 movie &quot; from top to bottom , and all this is a brand name in the film -- from the sponsors is brand x . 
this brand , Qualcomm Stadium 史泰普 center ... 
these people , living with the movie eternal together -- never 
this film is this idea of discovery -- 迈克尔·坎森 : this is a little over . 
what ? &quot; 迈克尔·坎森 : this is a little over a homeostatic , always ? 
i mean to repeat and often 迈克尔·坎森 : i was 随口 talk about . 
this is to highlight 
it &apos;s &quot; eternal . never . &quot; 
but we not only the sponsors to brand of those in the video in every should brand to a series of products . 
so , we sell a pair of shoes , the shoes are together , the foot shoes ... 
&quot; the movie &quot; 卖座 is the best in the history of the car in the history of the best to drink drink , and the movie &quot; the most 卖座 movie &quot; 
泽维尔·柯查尔 : so is to say , is not just show you a brand is part of the people &apos;s lives , but for the movie ? brand by john locke systematized 斯普尔 brand : the funding this film . 
john locke systematized 普尔 the : in fact , we &apos;re calling the entire process of marketing 
the film is the transparency . 
in the video , you &apos;ll see a brand marketing calling the entire process 
this is the whole movie 从头至尾 , the idea of the video . 
along the way i want to help CEG 
robert 弗里德曼 : what &apos;s interesting is the first heard this , i think this is in the audience is very respectful 
but i don &apos;t know that people can &apos;t accept 
泽维尔·柯查尔 : you have to have an expected -- i don &apos;t want to use the word &quot; position , because it with a negative colors -- you think this film to the result of that ? what john locke systematized 斯普尔 : i don &apos;t know . 
well , photographed by david the film cost ? 
1.5 million and 大卫·柯恩 : ok . 
约翰·卡门 : i think we want to deal with these brand would be very difficult for these big brands , but certainly support worth a try . 
泽维尔·柯查尔 : who know , your film , and then we may come as a group of 胡吹 侃 with the sea . 
john locke systematized 普尔 the : do you think they would do what the answer ? 
now the . 鲁德尔弗 : they most would reject 
john locke systematized 普尔 the : they refused to film itself , and the reason is because i ? 
约翰·卡门 : there are all 
john locke systematized 普尔 不容乐观 : the . 
gentlemen , can you help me ? i need help . 
迈克尔·坎森 : i can help you . 
john locke systematized 普尔 : the great . 迈克尔·坎森 : good . 
great . 
迈克尔·坎森 : we have to lock brand 
the john locke systematized 普尔 迈克尔·坎森 : yeah . so , it &apos;s very difficult . 
you &apos;re going to of those people ... 
迈克尔·坎森 : we have some many contacts . john locke systematized 斯普尔 : okay . 
switch off the cameras 
john locke systematized 普尔 the : i thought , &quot; take off the cameras in private mean to talk about &quot; 
it turns out , it means &quot; we don &apos;t want to do with your film , &quot; 
john locke systematized 普尔 the : so , one by one of these companies out . 
no one would be willing to help this film . 
i &apos;m amazed 
they &apos;re not any interest in this project . 
my mind , i thought , ads with solid is the idea of your product in front of as many people to get as many people see you . 
especially in the world in the old medium new media sundry fragmented you don &apos;t use this to a new kind of information 传送方式 to the masses . 
no , this is just the idea of my personal 
the problem is , you look at my idea has a fatal mistake of it here . 
no , this is actually a nothing wrong . 
this is not the problem . 
this is acceptable . 
but , this graph represents one of the problem . 
you know , if you look in google images of transparency and transparency , &quot; &quot; this is -- this is the top one comes to influencing access to personal wealth search results . 
i love your mode , 谢尔盖·布林 the co-founders of google . 
this is the problem : transparency -- not easy to understand a public 弄虚作假 transparent visible , easy to get the information properties and run a business -- and a sense , is probably the biggest problem . 
you see , recently , we often hear the word transparency . 
our politicians , our president ceo they &apos;re even use the word 
however , the ability to practice 陡然 happening . 
why ? transparency is a flood beast like -- and this was in 吼叫 , but we freeze the action . 
it makes people -- &apos;d not opaque , as this strange a small 
looks 凶险 . 
so what is 凶险 ? 
eat a big bowl Cool Whip ice cream 
pretty 凶险 
when i started a conversation with companies told them that we want to tell a story that they said , &quot; oh , of course we want you to tell a story . 
we want you to tell a story , we just want to tell our story . &quot; 
when i was a kid . i sometimes see my father -- he was in 扯谎 are always with his staring at me see the way -- he would say , &quot; son , every single story has three . 
here &apos;s your story , there &apos;s my story , and the real story . &quot; 
you see , we want to use this film to tell true story . 
and then there &apos;s only a company to help me -- because i have many 约翰·邦德 and 理查德·科尔申波姆 交情 -- and i realized that people don &apos;t like please , please remember i had to skip the middle with my team and the negotiation 
you suddenly began to realize that -- or when i began to realize that -- you start with those , for you to understand is a popular brand . 
john locke systematized 斯普尔 narrator : i have two friends are made of hollywood largest film like me , i actually knew independent film making little cost of friends . 
and i photographed the hollywood movie friends tell me , the success of the benefit of their brand sponsors 
and i &apos;m the cost of making little independent film friends said , &quot; how can we do this big of hollywood movie ? &quot; 
and this film is called &quot; the most 卖座 movie &quot; 
so in the video of how are we going to look at this brand Ban ? 
when i was ready to go out , when i turn on cabinet Ban you will see a body fluids 
whenever i with somebody meeting today i would say , &quot; clean enough , you want ? 
are you ready ? you look a little nervous . 
i &apos;m going to help you relax . 
maybe you can use for before . &quot; 
we &apos;ll put these good people go to a body fluids 
whether it &apos;s &quot; glow extraordinary 花香 &quot; or &quot; heaven &quot; there &apos;s always a for you . 
we &apos;re facing men and women with these products -- solid , walk franc , a body fluids , or 膏状 一应俱全 
this is roughly . 
now i &apos;m going to answer any question to you know about you . 
well , 凯伦·弗兰克 : we are a small brand 
as you say to little cost is a movie , we just beginning to brand 
we don &apos;t like other big brands 财大气粗 . 
and these campaign -- you know , to be able to focus on Ban -- this is where we 
john locke systematized 普尔 the , you can use any brand Ban this word ? 
how Ban very 
凯伦·弗兰克 a good question : 
woman : cutting-edge technology 
john locke systematized 普尔 : the technology is not a description of the best way is that people in the body fluids grounding 腋下 . 
man : we &apos;re talking about ; it cleans bold 
and i thought , &quot; clean &quot; is this becomes a series of products of the positive control sensorily , and those 干爽 comfort &quot; 
it makes you feel it cleans 
how do you want to clean -- three times more clean cleans 
these can produce 积极效果 
that &apos;s a frightening , millions of corporate group . 
so i ? an ordinary person how do you think ? 
i have to ask the streets of people like me , is people are sardinia 乙 nail 
they need to tell their own brand 
john locke systematized 斯普尔 narrator : what will you describe your brand ? 
man : i brand ? 
i don &apos;t know . 
i like a very good dress 
the combination of mammal 古风 skateboarders funk style is laundry until today . 
john locke systematized 普尔 , the : well , what is the brand ? 
and the different : john locke systematized 斯普尔 : different . 
man : i think is what i should be the style 暗色 &quot; memes . &quot; 
and i like black gray . 
i would put a package like them and i like crystals package 
woman : if dan is a brand that he might is a classic 敞篷车 like an 梅塞德斯 . 
man 2 : i brand i called it &quot; eclectic &quot; 
woman # 2 : a little bit of a hippie brooklyn , kind of yoga a little girl -- i don &apos;t know . 
man # 3 : i love pet dogs 
my pet toy , even go across the country , the world . 
i think that &apos;s my brand 
in this distorted little industry , that &apos;s my brand 
men 4 : i brand is &quot; fedex , &quot; i &apos;m distribution . 
five : &quot; all the men had drunk the writers &quot; 
this ? 
lawyers : i brand &apos;re a lawyer 
tom : i was &quot; tom cards &quot; 
john locke systematized 普尔 the : but we can &apos;t all be &quot; tom the cards , &quot; but i always find is &quot; 暗色 . &quot; and &quot; the integration of eclectic &quot; 
and i realized that , i need a experts 
i would be able to read a i think , a who can really helped me understand what is the brand personality . &quot; 
so i in pittsburgh found a company called Olson Zaltman 
they helped 雀巢 , proctor and gamble is the Febreze 贺曼 Hallmark , and they wait brand brand personality . 
if they can help the brand , then they must be able to help me 
narrator : you take pictures 艾比加尔 brought right ? 
john locke systematized 普尔 the : i brought . the first picture is my 全家福 
艾比加尔 : tell me this picture tell you what &apos;s the question . 
john locke systematized 普尔 the : these people to help me for the world . 
艾比加尔 : this is what the world . 
john locke systematized 普尔 the : the world ? i think you the world is the world of your life -- all the people around you , your friends and family your lifestyle , your own work . 
this has a reaching for germinate , and for me to this place is my home in the west virginia . 
艾比加尔 : the next picture ? 
john locke systematized 普尔 : the next one : this is my day of the happiest 
this with you : 艾比加尔 ourselves what ? 
john locke systematized 普尔 the : this and i want to be , what kind of people . 
i love new things 
i love strange things . 
艾比加尔 : tell me , &quot; why &quot; -- and this is going to help ? 
the knife bend that mean ? you &apos;re out in which stage ? 
why ? red 重整旗鼓 is so important ? 
please explain that 
what about not in your . 
you through what 蜕变 ? 
not necessarily fear . you &apos;re sitting in a what ? 
john locke systematized 普尔 the : ah ... ! and 艾比加尔 : thank you . no , i thank you . 
艾比加尔 : thank you . and john locke systematized 斯普尔 patient : you &apos;re doing great . 
艾比加尔 : yes . john locke systematized 斯普尔 : well , thank you very much . 
yeah , i don &apos;t know how the end result 
and there &apos;s too much complex complex things . 
it &apos;s left 林赛 , this idea : first impressions your brand there are two different personalities 相辅相成 are two sides -- john locke systematized 摩根·斯普尔 brand is a very thoughtful and 玩世不恭 brand 
these two very good together . 
it &apos;s almost a contradiction . 
i think some companies often 偏重 advantage of the only one of them and don &apos;t do 
most companies predilection to -- this is human nature to look away from illness -- maybe they get from the fear and so on and you run the exact opposite you actually put it all become the positive factor , that &apos;s great 
so what &apos;s brand like this ? 
the first is the classic , apple 
there &apos;s the target , in , which is my Coopers wii with its bodily activity , which is my , JetBlue 
some brands , &quot; is &quot; 玩世不恭 some brands have a mind of deep and these are not a brand , but a both have a mind , and some 玩世不恭 brand , is very powerful 
john locke systematized 普尔 玩世不恭 the : a brand , it &apos;s a mind . so your brand ? 
if someone you describe their branding , your brand personality how would you describe ? 
if you 高调 ? you &apos;re going to keep people was euphoric . ? 
brand or something ? 
if your brand , conservative , 矜持 沉稳 much ? 
brand 玩世不恭 高调 Fresh much like a song that new fashion , like risk that happened , forward-thinking 埃罗尔·弗林 bold , flexible , secular 甘道夫 霸气 like that , and mystery magic 
or your brand as much ? 
you place like james bond , around for 老道 that ? 
if you see , traditional , 显赫 &apos;re still , conservative 煽 like oprah that ? 
if you trustworthy , safe , reliable 稳重 , familiar with the sacred ideas and wisdom , like the dalai lama or 尤达 master these characters that the world ? 
from this film , we &apos;ve found over 500 home 高调 brand or as companies and they said , &quot; no , &quot; they don &apos;t want to run on with the film . 
they don &apos;t want to run in the film , mostly because they don &apos;t control they couldn &apos;t control the end product 
but we finally got 17 home companies control surrender and they &apos;re willing to work with people like me , they both have a mind and 玩世不恭 people working with the power of the stories they &apos;re completely to tell the story of the world -- the advertisers never dig story . 
they asked us to talk about the marketing in story , we learn about how they &apos;ll find your by mri brain areas of the desire and marketing , the movie . 
we went from outside sao paulo . 
for the city in the past five years , 张贴 &apos;t put any billboard in any poster , without any , nothing . 
and we went to school district here these companies , trying to put an ad into the united states , all of the financial nervous . 
let me unexpected is , let me get the most feedback or let me get the biggest harvest is i try to deal with those things . 
these brand is how do . 
they &apos;ll skip skip through the medium , medium think that &apos;s probably not put on my interests . 
i &apos;m going to directly with artists negotiation 
and with him i &apos;m going to create a yes to get people to film this meant something that we got the world . 
it &apos;s good for you ? what do successful ? 
this film in the first film festival 圣丹斯 up , we look at . 
according to the data , the movie Burrelles since january up for the first degrees -- that &apos;s not the whole movie -- we got the media to be a time of the movie . 
all together , long story for two weeks and a half 
this is still the web -- not the newspaper magazine , or tv . 
this film haven &apos;t even launched 
on the internet could not watching online 
in other countries have released . 
and finally , the film &apos;ve got a lot of attention 
for such a film , and this is a good we were looking for advertising client doesn &apos;t have to participate . 
i believe that if you dare to try to take educational risks these risks , will be . 
i believe that when you don &apos;t get people you &apos;re taking them wrong 
i believe , when you educate your employees not an adventure then you &apos;re in the interests of the company in personal danger 
i think , want to get progress we have to encourage people to be risky . 
we have to encourage people don &apos;t fear very dangerous . 
finally , i think we have to confront moving forward . 
have to bear in the cage 
face to face the risk of fear . 
a 口接 face a risk 
and finally , we have to embrace transparency . 
now , more than ever before , a little bit of integrity can produce strong . 
i said , by integrity and transparency my whole talk &quot; embrace transparency &quot; by my friend EMC funding in the commercial 7100 dollars on ebay they bought talk on the right 冠名 
EMC： be huge opportunity to benefit from a global company 
EMC for you to embrace transparency , &quot; what &quot; 
and thank you very much 
june , 翰 : so , by 摩根 贯彻 transparency for the dominant theme of dollars that 7100 where to get ? 
john locke systematized 普尔 the question : what does it say too well . 
in my pocket is one of those seeds Foundation 母公司 sapling foundation , and the check 7100 dollars a year as my introduction of the ted 
you good afternoon . 
i want to show you something . 
this as a pixel , a the pixels . 
in the lab , we call it is sensing design . 
let me tell you about this stuff . 
now if you took this picture -- i &apos;m italian , every italian boy bedroom the wall to have this picture they grew up with . 
but i show you this , and the reason is because some interesting things to happen in the game F1 equation in the last few decades . 
ago , if you want to one F1 the game , you just need a budget , and then put your budget bet on good 车手 in a car . 
if your car and 车手 good enough , you get one . 
now , if you want to one , in fact , you need also some other things like this -- some of it in your car for thousands of sensors to be connected to the car , transmit 进系统 the relevant information , and processed and use it to feedback decided to make it real car itself do with information gathering change . 
this is , in real time , called the engineers surveillance . 
basically , the system , including two parts a is a driver . 
now , this is interesting is starting to anyone in real time it &apos;s in our life . 
our cities , in the last couple of years , has been the web , electronic industry is . 
they become like wireless charge 放电脑 . 
and wireless open , as a computer , and they start to make different response could and control . 
if we can optimize city , in fact , this is a flying . 
and there &apos;s a bit , i want to say , only two percent of the earth &apos;s surface , but they account for 50 percent of the world &apos;s population . 
their energy consumption 75-- percent of the co2 emissions produce 80 percent . 
so if we prioritize city , it would be a flying . 
in these cities , all these sensor and control we &apos;re entering the daily things . 
this is beau 拉·安东内利 this summer , in new york museum of modern art exhibition . 
&quot; and i talk about . &quot; 
we , our environment , starting to give us a feedback . 
a certain sense , like every atom in into sensors and 制动器 . 
it &apos;s fundamentally changed we as humans , and the relationship between nature . 
some sense , it was meters 开朗 琪 rosey ancient dream ... 
you know , when krishna meters 开朗 琪 sculpting moses like , in the last he picks up a hammer , throw moses like -- actually , you see on the bottom little 凹槽 -- saying , &quot; you make , why not speak , why ? &quot; 
today , the first time , our environment to give us a feedback . 
i &apos;m going to show you a few cases -- one time , as we go to the sense of awareness , and to respond to our environment . 
let &apos;s start with sensor beginning . 
i want to share with you the first project is actually our lab one of the first few project . 
that &apos;s in six months ago , and in italy . 
where we do is actually used as a new kind of network -- where we have the web and mobile phone -- through the network for any terminal the you &apos;ve elicited the city of information to understand how it works . 
the summer is a lucky -2006年 summer . 
this is just one in the world in italy . 
some of you may remember , there is an italian to france 齐达内 , was pretty 终场 ago , the mallet on that . 
anyway , italian end wins . 
now look at what happened , using grid in the show . 
you see in the city . 
you see a lot of rome 正中 theater , a 伯河 . 
this is in the morning , game ago . 
you look at the top of the type of time . 
and there , here on the phone , walking . 
the beginning -- quiet . 
for 进球 法国队 进球 . italy . 
and a half , you quickly on a phone call , a toilet . 
the second half , the end of the game . 
the first add , the second add . 
benki , the mallet on to the head . 
italian won . ha-ha . 
night , everybody to downtown celebration . 
you can see . 
the next day , everybody to downtown and 凯旋 team and prime minister . 
and then 人流 started to turn back . 
you see this place called the west mo 赛场 horse , from rome , people started to celebrate -- there &apos;s going to talk about a party , in the end of the see . 
words , it &apos;s just how do we make sense of the city , with this one example of a few years ago , we can &apos;t do it . 
another briefly about perception example : it &apos;s not about , it &apos;s what we use and consumption . 
today , we know that every same came from . 
this is a map showing you an apple computer , how the 零配件 together . 
but we know these 零配件 very few where the deceased . 
so this project , we actually invented little labels to track the waste the system to make it move . 
we actually and some volunteers who want to help in seattle our contributors , a year ago , for those people discarded tabs on something -- different kinds of things , as you see these -- those of us want to throw it away . 
we put a little 集成块 , little tag , in the garbage and started tracking it . 
this is that we observe . 
in seattle . 
a week later . 
and from this information , we realized that system have a lot of inefficient . 
i can actually use less energy do the same thing . 
this data that &apos;s not . 
but there &apos;s a lot of garbage logistics and deck is things to happen . 
there &apos;s another thing we believe that , if we want to those we throw the cup , it didn &apos;t disappear , it is in a corner of the earth . 
we have a plastic bottle , you &apos;re going to stay there . 
if we showed this to people , and then we can for some behavior change . 
so this is all about this project . 
my colleagues at mit , 阿萨夫·彼得曼 , he would tell you a little bit more about perception and a lot of we use cognition can do amazing things , but i want to start with the second part to start , this is actually about our environment . 
the first project is about a few years ago in spain 萨拉戈萨 do . 
it started out in the mayor of a question , he found that we use the southern europe , in public here with the traditional water . 
question is : technologies , new technology , how to make it 锦上添花 ? 
one idea is from mit , is about a research group , imagine a pipe , you have it , valves , 电磁阀 读数 table , on and off . 
you &apos;ve created a water as pixel water table . 
if those pixels . you can , it shows you could spend , images , the text . 
you get near it , it might even be close to make you skip , as you can see this picture . 
we showed this 贝洛克 mayor . 
he loved it . 
and then we get the expo entrance to build a building . 
we call it the digital water pavilions . 
the entire building with water built into it . 
or not the window , but when you walk into it , it will make you in the corner . 
the roof is also covered by water . 
if there &apos;s a little bit of the wind , if you want to little water without out , you can actually reduce the roof . 
or even the entire building , the building will disappear , like this . 
these days , you can see in the winter often this is when they get to the roof , people will say , &quot; they &apos;re on the building . &quot; 
no , they have no activists it , just as it down , building book was almost disappear . 
this is the work of water . 
you can see how people into a very . 
this is i &apos;m trying to become don &apos;t want to get wet , in a curtain 开水 sensors . 
i should tell you one night when all the work of sensors stop . 
but it made that night become more interesting . 
all the children in 萨拉戈萨 to this building , because the way into the building be a little different . 
no longer open to the building itself , but you get into the water was a curtain will be different from that you have to skip this time to don &apos;t get wet . 
and , for us , and it &apos;s also interesting , because , as an architect , an engineer , a designer , we often think about how people use we design things . 
but the real always unexpected . 
this is the glamour of doing these things are using and interactive . 
this is a pixel in physics , the water , and then when you do projection 
and it reminded me of the next thing i want to show you . 
this is , imagine that these like 素能飞 . 
imagine you have a little can move the helicopter , and each one has a little can lighting . the pixels -- almost like a piece of can move in the clouds . 
a video . 
imagine a helicopter , like we &apos;ve just seen , and other helicopter , spontaneous , moving . 
so you get this cloud . 
you &apos;ll get a screen or bend show , like this -- a two-dimensional general configuration . 
or , but a three-dimensional , here , is points of light , and not like the location . 
you can use different way . 
you can imagine the scale , the size of the different or different came to get the depth of field . 
but all of that &apos;s just a 3d pixel cloud of it , and you can pull through it , and in many , many ways . 
this is the same form of a standard down like the grid . 
when you turn , you actually look at this . and we see . 
imagine if each one of people are being controlled . 
you can make each pixel have from people get the input , from people move , and so on . 
i show you some of the first time display . 
we &apos;re working with 罗伯托·博 working together , one of the top of a ballet dancer -- metropolitan art museum and milan the opera callas star -- to of motion capture it 3d to use it to 
you can see 罗伯托 in dance . 
you can on the left , the pixels 
it &apos;s real 3维 scan and motion capture . 
and you can represent this whole . 
you can always jump . 
but once you have the pixels , you can manipulate them with colored and gravity and rotate to control movement . 
we want to use this as a flight fire of the bottom . 
i want to show you one last we &apos;re doing . 
it &apos;s our olympic and do to london . 
it &apos;s called the digital cloud . 
this idea , again , imagine , we can get you to do something in to change the environment -- is the number of us to build -- like a cloud barn building , but it &apos;s digital cloud . 
you can think about to give a pixel of money . 
i think the last few years of what &apos;s extraordinary is , the last few decades , we went through physical world to digital world . 
now , the knowledge and products to the internet could 端口 everywhere . 
today , the first -- obama campaign -- we can tell us from the digital world to sort of power to go back to the physical world . 
it &apos;s doable , in this case , we want to use it to design and create a logo . 
it means in cities build some of the building . 
but the future it can get close to solve the challenges today -- think about climate change or co2 emissions from the digital world -- how we go back to the physical world . 
so we can actually give you a collective engagement doing it . 
this is a cloud digital cloud , and with pixel in reality , with the cloud of forms clouds way to use the particles . 
these particles cloud is water , it &apos;s digital pixels . cloud . 
this is in london . 
you can get to experience of different experience . 
you can actually see in the olympics , 2012 important moment , and actually use it as the bridge to society . 
and some of the clouds and you can get to the top , like in the new mountain . 
you can get them . 
this is a new digital night torch -- but most importantly , created a kind of anybody can get to the peak of experience . 
thank you . 
my name is 阿密 lamanites 
18月 ago , i was in google , there &apos;s another work with my boss i came up with this idea in art , and i want to do things museum of my boss &apos;s here today she agreed 
over the 18 months 
through a lot of fun and the story , i can tell you about walked nine countries , with a very interesting museum 17 
but i &apos;m going to focus on that . 
i can tell stories to explain why we need to do this . 
my personal story very simple on the slide did it with is how to go visit these art . 
i grew up in india 
i got a very good education , i don &apos;t want to complain about what , but i don &apos;t have a lot of art museum and visit these . 
so when i had the opportunity to travel a visit these museum , i started learning a lot of things . 
when i was at google i 萌发 into the technology to make it easier for you to see . 
so we built a team , a great group we started doing this work . 
i get in you and tell you a couple of this project launch after a couple of interesting story . 
so , very simple , you get GoogleArtProject . 
you see all these museum 
you see 乌菲兹 museum , you see the museum of modern art museum , the netherlands 艾尔米塔什 national museum , van gogh museum 
now let me to one of my favorite metropolitan art museum 
there are two types of into , very simple . 
click , bang , you go into the museum , 
no matter where you are , mexico , in mumbai . 
you turn around , you just enjoying 
you want in a museum in a press above 
you click a , above the dove in 
you &apos;re into it , you want to end the hallway 
to have fun . 
investigate 
thank you . i &apos;m not talking about the best part of ? 
now i have one of my favorite painting 彼得·勃鲁盖尔 the harvest . 
and i saw this + . 
if the museum give us the imagery , you click on it . 
and this is one of those 幅图象 
this is all the neurons data 
if you &apos;re really interested in the art you can click on here , but now i &apos;m going to give it to close . 
this is one of the imagery we take this is what we &apos;re 象素 千兆 technology 
for example , this imagery , 10 billion a pixel 
a lot of people ask me , &quot; you have 10 billion a pixel ? &quot; 
and i &apos;m going to show you 10 billion a pixel give you . 
you can 简便 to contract . 
you see some interesting things . 
i love this guy , he &apos;s 无价 . 
but you really want to one 
so i went around and see if i see there is . 
i said , &quot; wait a minute , and it &apos;s pretty interesting . &quot; 
near , i start paying attention to these kids are throwing something 
i study , a few people with museum 联系人 talk about discovering that this is a game called &#91; 不明 play , with a confession 礼拜二 geese in the day . 
they were very popular . 
i don &apos;t know why they do , but i learned something new . 
now entering deeper , you can see split . 
now let me show you a picture i &apos;m going to zoom out , you can really see all 
this is our where this is that painting . 
the best haven &apos;t talked about , wait a minute ? 
now let &apos;s jump into the museum of modern art . 
another favorite : &quot; 星夜 &quot; 
i just tell you it &apos;s all about the details . 
so if you want to see 笔法 ? 
if you want to see , van gogh what is created this image . 
you to zoom in , really zoom in . 
my close to my favorite i can actually see split 
this is &quot; 星夜 , &quot; i want to , i &apos;ve never seen it . 
i &apos;m going to show you another i love . 
here &apos;s a lot of things , i don &apos;t have time to go through 
this is really cool a collection , called 
any of you ever , whether you &apos;re rich or poor whether or not you have a gorgeous house . &quot; 
you can go , build your own network museum in all this work build their own collection 
it &apos;s very simple , you enter into i created this is called the power of 变焦 变焦 and you can look at 
this is the national 艺术馆 &quot; who are &quot; 
you can write note , and then send friend really a conversation about you look at these things about the question . 
so i want to conclude , for me , the main thing is that these brilliance art is not from google 
i personally think it &apos;s not even from museum 
i should say that may not 
it &apos;s from these artists 
this is my 谦诚 in this process . 
i mean , i hope this digital media for their art win 公证 to show their work . 
and now i get the big question is : &quot; do you do is to replicate experience to the museum ? &quot; 
and the answer is no 
this is a kind of thing . 
and i said that , thank you . 
thank you . 
if you can you better than today , you want to be ? 
for example , you can have some change the genes , you have better things , to be more precise , more good and faster . 
or you want to become more healthy , more strong , more energy . 
you want to become more attractive , more confidence ? 
healthy to live a long time , this ? 
or , you want to have more creativity . 
you want ? 
if you can only have the same , you want ? 
( audience : creativity . 
creativity . 
how many people going to pick creativity ? 
raise your hand , let me see . 
there &apos;s some . maybe and here we have the same number of creativity . 
and that &apos;s very good . 
how many want things ? 
more . 
health ? 
less . 
longevity ? 
ah , most . i &apos;m a doctor , and i &apos;m happy . 
if you can have this one change , the world is going to be very different . 
this is just imagine ? 
or say , it might be to happen ? 
evolution is a permanent , at ted forum . but today i &apos;m going to tell you about this topic a doctor . 
the 20th century , the famous a geneticist , t . 杜布 尚斯基 and Dobzhansky t wells , and he &apos;s holy communion man , in russia 东正教 church . he wrote an article called , &quot; everything biology , unless it &apos;s hard to see the evolution of ideas to think about . &quot; 
now , if you don &apos;t believe in biological evolution evidence of now you can turn off your hearing aids , take out of your own personal communications device -- you get allows -- or take a look at it again 卡瑟林·舒尔茨 Kathryn Schulz and found that book about wrong . because the rest of the talks that you will feel no meaning . 
if you believe in biological evolution , think about this : that &apos;s about the past , it &apos;s about the future ? 
that &apos;s happened in other organism , or are we also going to happen ? 
this is a picture of the tree of life . 
in this picture 树状 from the center , and i put in all directions out , because of the tree of life and if you look at the edge of the species , in those branches , the evolutionary terms , are successful , . that means that the degrees a place for the environment . 
the human part , in this way , in a edge , of course , is the end of our most interested in . 
we go from a common ancestor branches and modern chimpanzees separate out about 600 million or 800 million years ago . 
and in that time , there &apos;s about 20 to 25 a hominid species . 
it took some to . 
we live here for 13 million years . 
look , we seem to this tree of life so far from other species , but in fact , in many respects , on our cells , the fundamental basic fabric is almost the same . 
you know ? we can use and a normal human to build the structure of the bacteria insulin protein and used to cure diabetes ? 
this is not a human insulin ; this is the same protein in biochemical level of the pancreas with our very hard . 
i said , you know we each bacteria belly of a bacteria more than our bodies ? 
maybe there are 10 times more . 
and you think about it , when 安东尼奥·达马西奥 Antonio r Damasio image of , ask you , you would think bacteria ? 
our gut is a very good environment , for the bacteria . 
warm , dark , moist , very comfortable . 
and we &apos;ll give them almost all of the nutrients they &apos;re not the any effort . 
for bacteria , it &apos;s 逍遥自在 occasionally , i don &apos;t tend to be the colonies emissions . 
but still , bacteria , you &apos;re a very good living , and they do to your life is necessary . 
they help digest what you need nutrients . 
and they also protect your some disease resistance . 
but the future will be ? 
whether we &apos;re the balance in evolution , as a species ? 
or , our fate is going to be different species -- other can maybe more adaptable to the environment ? 
now let &apos;s go back to the big bang , 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , it &apos;s about 4.5 ago -- primitive life , the first 跡象 three , four billion years ago , the earth -- the first multi-cellular organisms , i think it was in 8亿 or 10亿年 ago -- and then finally , this is a human species in the last 13 million years . 
in this universe of the great symphony , life on earth as a simple scores ; animals , is a single session and human beings , it &apos;s a 装饰音 . 
that &apos;s us . 
that &apos;s this part of the interesting , i hope you enjoy . 
i was in college , i was my first session biology class . 
i was shocked , biology is elegant , beautiful . 
and i was fascinated by the power of evolution , and realized that there was a very basic stuff : in most of the form of life , in single-cell organism , each cell simple cells , and all the genes get warm energy , cells . 
but in more cells out , it changes . 
to enter sexual reproduction in . 
and it &apos;s really important , sexual reproduction in ways to deliver genes , and other parts , become a consumption . 
in fact , you can say we 必然性 of death in evolution and sexual reproduction in simultaneously . 
now i have to say that when i was in college , i thought , well , sex / death , sex / death , for sex and die -- that sounds pretty good year for the last year , but i started to produce a lot of questions . 
i began to understand , george Burns 乔治伯恩斯 and he had been performing in las vegas , until he 90 years old . 
one night , and somebody said that he lived hotel . 
he opened the door . 
in front of him , is a beautiful wear 舞女 very little . 
and she looked at he said , &quot; i want to do here is a big love . &quot; 
&quot; okay , &quot; george said , &quot; well , i just drink soup . &quot; why shakespeare to Soup Super . 
i began to realize that as a physician i &apos;ve always been trying to do is a different direction in the direction of evolution -- is not absolutely , just different . 
i &apos;ve been trying to keep 
want to make our health . 
we want to make disease events . 
we want to live longer . 
evolution is to deliver genes , and for the next generation to generation to survive in the next generation . 
from evolution perspective , and we are like the rocket 助推器 to send &quot; genes &quot; charge to orbit and then the next layer by the ocean . 
i think we should all be understand the woods 迪·艾伦 Woody allen , said , he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to through my work , and immortal 
&quot; i think by don &apos;t die and immortal . &quot; 
evolution , not necessarily want to live longer . 
it may not necessarily looking at the biggest or along the strongest , or the most rapidly and it &apos;s not even the smartest . 
evolution want to do is the best they can adapt to the environment . 
this is a single test for success . 
in the ocean , the bacteria are 耐热 they can live in the steam , or , if there is a fish , there will be 苏斯维 cook , fish , but they can make life in a beautiful environment . 
so , what that means , when we look back evolution happen , and we &apos;ll think about the evolution of human , especially we look up to the next stage , i should say , a lot of possibilities . 
the first , we &apos;re not going to evolve . 
we &apos;ve reached a balance . 
this is probably the reason , first of all , we can save a lot of genes , what will be eliminated and remove the most people in the genome . 
secondly , we are placed a species of our environment to adapt to our environment and our to adapt to the environment . 
and we migration , in all mixed up and it makes you don &apos;t in in isolation , and the state and it &apos;s evolution . 
the second , it &apos;s still conventional evolution , naturally , by nature driving force . 
this is the evolution of the slow 轮盘 around , can &apos;t keep . 
there &apos;s only isolated , and we as a species of our planet , and that would have seen , to change the way the evolution of the evolution of nature . 
but there is a third , a compelling , fun and people . 
i called it : new evolution -- a new way of nature &apos;s way , way mentoring and we made choices and as individuals to make . 
now , this was going to happen ? 
how do we could make this happen ? 
now let &apos;s think about reality , some of the people in the culture of their offspring , they do some selection . 
and in some cultures , they choose more redundant boys girls . 
for the society , it will be not good , but it &apos;s an individual and family make a choice . 
again , if you can to choose , is not simply to choose your choice , but the gender of the children in your body to do something to adjust genes can cure or preventing the disease . 
if you really can do some genetic to adjust to eradicate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s cancer or reduce eradicate stroke , or not ? 
don &apos;t you want to change your genes are doing ? 
if we look forward , these changes are going to be very possible . 
human genome project from 1990 , and for 13 years time . 
it took 27亿 dollars . 
after the project done in 2004 , you can do the same thing about 20 million dollars , three to four months . 
today , you get an entire sequence the human genome three billion base pairs of it costs about two million dollars , it &apos;s about a week . 
not too long can achieve the human genome a thousand dollars , and more and more people can do . 
in a week ago , the national academy a prize , ray &quot; our &quot; 弗朗西斯·阿诺德 and arnold Francis Willem Stemmer and 威廉·思特梅尔 and two scientist independent developed technique can get evolution and natural faster more good protein that can be more effectively . 弗朗西斯·阿诺德 Francis arnold , and call &quot; 定向进化 . &quot; 
for many years ago , 拉斯克 Albert Lasker Prize i found out of the mountain into a scientist Shinya Yamanaka 弥 and he has his take a mature skin cells , a mother and by fiber tissue cells to manipulate just four genes , he led to cells back to a pluripotent stem cells -- a are going to be any cells in our body . 
these are . 
from the same technology is that bacteria can generate the body of the virus insulin it will not just protecting you get a resistance them , to other our . 
do you believe in , there &apos;s an experiment on prevention flu vaccine is from a kind of tobacco plants grow the cells . 
can you imagine tobacco also have a good thing ? 
these are today , in reality , and in the future , there are many more possibilities . 
and think about another two small changes . 
you can change your body cells , that if you can change your children cells ? 
and if you can change the sperm egg , or change the new fertilized , can give you a better chance more healthy life -- get diabetes , disappear 血友病 , reduce the risk of cancer ? 
who don &apos;t want a healthier children ? 
and then the same to deconstruct technology , the same technology can produce defense disease , and will change that we can integrate some super properties , the ability to decisions -- better things . 
why not 肯·詹宁斯 ken Jenniings of humor , and especially you can have the next generation &apos;s the same humor systems ? 
why not fast contract muscles will let &apos;s run faster longer ? 
why not going to live longer ? 
these are going to be . 
and when we are in a position we can give the next generation , we can integrate we want , we would change the old model for new the evolution of evolution . 
we &apos;re going to have this process general maybe 100,000 years , but we can compressed to 1,000 -- maybe even in the next 100 years . 
these changes our grandchildren , or their grandchildren will have . 
they &apos;re using these choices ? to create a better society ? more successful , more friendly society ? 
or we &apos;re talking about selective the ability to change our choose from some of the person rather than another some of the people ? 
if we would create a social more boring and unity ? or more and more for greater diversity ? 
this is all the problem is to get that we face . 
and most importantly , we can promote intelligence , or inhere intelligence , make us more intelligent to do these ? 
or good or bad , than you think it &apos;s going to quickly , we &apos;re going to have those choices . 
thank you . 
i was jesse , this is my journey of the box . 
but when i show you what i was in it , i &apos;m going to make a very open confess , which is , i &apos;m extremely with clothes . 
i love looking for an they &apos;re wearing them , recently , they also fell in love with took pictures of them and write about blogs , every a different kind of crazy , complexity , has the most appropriate that a room . 
but i don &apos;t buy any new stuff . 
me was consignment buy from 跳蚤市场 and 旧货 store . 
oh , thank you . 
let me reduce consignment shopping buy clothes for the environment , and to my purse . 
i can meet all kinds of interesting people ; we can save money give it to a charity ; i was getting it into a pie , retail ; it became my personal finding is located . 
i think , i &apos;m going to find ? 
i was going to be the size of the ? 
it &apos;s my favorite color ? 
below in 20 dollars ? 
if the answer is &quot; is , &quot; i feel won . 
i want to go back to my suitcase to tell you this incredible a week at ted , i brought some . 
there are so many cloth what would take ? 
so i &apos;m going to show you what i brought to . 
i brought these seven lanes 內裤 . 
which is a week i travel 箱内 內裤 . 
i bet i would find in the palm springs , i need all the clothes . 
if you &apos;re seeing here is that , i don &apos;t wear panties , &quot; come here at ted , &quot; -- that i actually found some new stuff . 
and now i really want to show you my a week . 
isn &apos;t it sounds nice ? 
of course , and i &apos;ll talk about a life with you and mentoring , whether you believe , these are my old in their in &quot; new &quot; adventures extract ideas . 
so we started from sunday . 
i called it &quot; blinking tigers . &quot; 
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of money can be magnetism . 
even if you can almost always not only to 50 dollars , can it &apos;s very impressive . 
this whole clothes , including coat used my 五十五 dollars , and i mean , it &apos;s a whole weeks of the most expensive wearing clothes . 
星期一： color is powerful . 
in biology , almost impossible to wear bright red pants , still feel worse . 
if you happy , you &apos;ll find other happy . 
mainstream are falling overplay . 
i spent a lot of time in my lifetime , want to do , and in the mainstream . 
do you . 
if you have all the right person , they not only would you know , they &apos;ll also . 
take your 童心 . 
sometimes they told me , that i like to play with me , or i let them think they seven years old . 
i love to smile , and they said , &quot; thank you . &quot; 
this is the confidence . 
if you think you wear , you were going to wear . 
if you don &apos;t think you wear it , that you must be right . 
from to every day , my mother told me that . 
but i got 30 years old , what does that mean . 
and i &apos;ll give you a quick . 
if you believe you &apos;re a beautiful people , no clothes 里里外外 , is that you can &apos;t wear good-looking . 
so some of you have no reason why . 
we can wear whatever they want , as . 
thank you . 
星期五： a universal truth -- a few words for you : king of the remix of light . 
and finally , 星期六： development of personal style . really is a great way to tell the world who you are , they don &apos;t need to say a word . 
it again and i can prove it for weeks at a time when people came to me , just because i wear . 
we &apos;re having a conversation . 
of course the &apos;re not going to travel in my little box . 
so before i go in brooklyn , i would put it all . 
because this weeks , i have to be . 
i don &apos;t need to 眷恋 things , because in the next the corner , never would have a crazy again , the steely colorful clothes waiting for me , as long as i brought love to find . 
thank you very much . 
thank you . 
this is the brain . 
your brain can divide it into two parts . 
the left brain , in terms of the main reason , and the right brain , the intuition . 
if we use 刻度线 the ability to measure brain for them , and our brains . 
for example , and this is somebody totally rational . 
this is a completely with someone . 
and you &apos;re going to take your brain in line where ? 
some people might choose this extreme situations , but i think most of the audience , your brain to a place like this -- two brain hemisphere and high potential . 
they &apos;re not too might each exclusion or whatever . 
and you can both rational . 
and i think is a lot of other experiments , quantum physicists have a good idea of the complex can put together . 
but also , we need a good intuition the can actually do it . 
so how do we improve force this intuition ? well we like to study things . 
our research and shuffling , and we &apos;ll see how it . 
and then we leverage our intuition . 
in fact , you also do the same thing . 
some of you may culture for many years intuition can just like a things in a places . 
i mean , it would be very strange , want you to consider a things and in two places , but you &apos;re not born with this concept , you are acquired culture . 
i remember seen a child in 阻 a car . 
he &apos;s just a learn step and not very good at this child , he &apos;s always fall . 
but i bet and 阻 play give him a car on a very valuable lesson , is the large objects don &apos;t have to easily through , and they stay in one place . 
this is the world have a very have conceptual model , unless you &apos;re a particle physicist . 
for particle physicist , that would be is a very bad model , because they don &apos;t study 阻 car , they study those little strange particles . 
when they study their particles , they think they &apos;re doing all kinds of really weird things -- like they can wear a wall , or they can also in two places . 
and they record , they called quantum mechanics up with this theory . 
this is a few years ago at the frontier of physics ; you need to describe quantum mechanics , tiny , tiny particles . 
but you don &apos;t need it to describe the big , everyday objects . 
that doesn &apos;t really in my intuition cognitive , maybe it &apos;s because i don &apos;t often study of the particles . 
well , i still have time to study them , just don &apos;t usually . 
and i &apos;d never seen them . 
i mean , nobody can see the particles . 
but that doesn &apos;t fit my logic . 
because if all things up by the particles and every particles fit quantum theory , that all things should follow quantum theory ? 
i couldn &apos;t find the reason why it does not follow . 
so for the whole thing i understand better if we some way to everyday every things that are also follow quantum theory . 
not that long ago , i started working . 
i made this . 
this is the first thing you can see it &apos;s also the quantum mechanics overlaid . 
here we see is a little computer chip . 
you can see in the middle of the green . 
that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to talk about the metal . 
this is a picture of it . 
focus on the . we see that . 
this is a very , very close to detect 金属片 of . 
we see a little 块金属 , it looks like like a diver stands , and its a bottom . 
i almost the same way and build computer chip strapped to their backs create this metal . 
i was a sterile operating room , and then i &apos;m alive 硅晶片 in all these big machine about 100 hours . 
in order to the end result , i have to make their own machines -- this 泳池 the hole in the device . 
this is the ability to do , but it &apos;s overlaid quantum need some help to do this . 
let me give you , for example . 
you know , in a crowded elevators is how uncomfortable ? 
i mean , when i was alone in the elevator , i can do all kinds of things , but when other people in when i stopped doing these things , because i don &apos;t want to out to other people , or , words , terrify other people . 
so that &apos;s not living quantum mechanics cash in on the same . 
the passenger it &apos;s not just not living people , but it &apos;s also crinkling the light coming wind in the wind and volume of 热度 . 
so , if we want to see this piece of metal of quantum mechanics , we wouldn &apos;t have all the other passengers out . 
this is what we do . 
we turn the lights , and then we put it in a vacuum pump , and all the air , and then we get it to a little bit more cooling 绝对零 degrees . 
now , in the elevator , little 金属片 can do anything it want to do . 
we measured it . 
we found it in very peculiar way in movement . 
it &apos;s in unison , and not static . 
it vibrate is like this -- like a picture of a 风箱 . 
just to give it a mild impact , we can make it vibrating but also not only in quantum mechanics -- some vibrational spectrum only going to happen . 
i &apos;m here to tell you is that some amazing things . 
one thing vibrate , but also no . what does that mean ? 
let &apos;s consider atoms . 
one example : all trillion form of atoms 金属片 is static and keep the same these atoms are up . 
only in particular , it &apos;s precisely the same time . 
the rest of the time they &apos;re not 定域 . 
that means every atom in the same time , in two places , and the whole 金属片 that in two places . 
i think this is really cool . 
it &apos;s true . 
i put themselves on the sterile &apos;re doing is worth . 
because , look at this , and the individual atom 金属片 about the worst of you that that individual 金属片 and the bad . 
so if a single 原子能 and in different two , that 金属片 can also in different two , so why you can &apos;t ? 
i mean , it &apos;s my rational thinking logic . 
so , imagine if you can also in 多个位置 , what would it look like ? 
your cognitive going to do with you in space 不定 domain of the problem ? 
this is a part of the story . 
when we put it , and look inside the box 金属片 , we see is just a piece . 
so i had to form a new instinct elevator of all , it seems that were actually in a very small space quantum object . 
you &apos;ve heard a lot about quantum physics is how to explain to connect with each other . 
well , that &apos;s not completely true ; it to a much broader , more than that . 
and these around , you and your connections , really . who you are . 
this is quantum profound and incredible . 
thank you . 
as you know , my job is to write a child &apos;s actually , i might be the child &apos;s the author . 
i always tell people i don &apos;t want to be as a scientist 
can you put my as a farmer , or in a black leather corset , but nobody had ever choose are farmers 
i &apos;m here to tell you about cycle and epiphany 
epiphany usually mean , you find out that you fall in certain circumstances 
you need four in the wall to find an epiphany 
this is a painting cycle . 
a friend of mine to draw -- 理查德·鲍林布罗克 
this is in a very complex i &apos;m going to tell you . 
my cycle in ohio 斯朵 60 century , from high school when i was a troublemaker 
i was a boy that was in housing to the people out of blood , until one teacher pull me out of this life . 
she took me to saving lives that i lived in the teacher &apos;s lounge in the bathroom 
she does she heroism do it for three years . but i had to leave the towns . 
with you , and eventually i 落脚 85 dollars , and in the san francisco 圣弗朗西科 , california -- met my love -- to find in the &apos; 80s , and i started to work in hiv is very necessary . 
about late at night before i &apos;ve got a teacher , 普斯顿 from the teachers telephone , she said , &quot; i need to see you 
i was very disappointed we never get to understand each other adults 
you can to ohio ? please put that you find people bring . 
i should mention i have actually -- pancreas cancer , but i &apos;d like you can ignore this part . 
so , the next day , we went to cleveland 
we met her , talking to her , we know who live in the late to get out of the patients . 
we found a for her , take care of her and she used to take care of her family because it is necessary things we need to know how to do 
this is as adults , i want to know my girls look at the end of the box . the powder in my hands . 
what happens is the end of the cycle that as a cycle -- i said i got an epiphany of self . 
this is an epiphany is part of life . 
she saved my life with my friend save her life . 
that are needed to do a life . 
it needs real and i &apos;m happy they &apos;ve been talking today . 
it also need to -- it needs to be dignity love and joy 
our job is to open to these for a walk . 
thank you . 
in 2007 , i think we need to redefine our consciousness of economic growth . 
our goal of family think when they want to live and work . they can have at least five different can choose competitive new households city . 
for this goal we have a long way to go . 
in the developing world there are billions of people in a city , they don &apos;t want to acceptance phase . 
but the amazing 利用价值 is it going to build more valuable than consume . 
so we can build a really easy for a few of the world , or a new city . 
you may think that sounds ridiculous . if you never thought of new city . 
but this is instead of building cities . 
imagine half the want to live in my apartment people have to live ; the other half haven &apos;t live in . 
you could add build a house to try to expand . 
but you know you 经手 of the ground and keep it is legal protections comfort and entertaining at all . 
do this with was very difficult . 
but you can &apos;t develop the area of building a new building , like 俗话说 stalls strong back to that . 
so i would propose government acting two new urban areas enough and it &apos;s called : the charter cities . 
i know about these , 哈维尔 , barack ca tower in 洪都拉斯 &apos;re thinking about space odyssey to plan . 
and about 50 洪都拉斯人 seven million a year of the american they want to ask , what can they do to make sure that it can make these people in 洪都拉斯 doing the same thing , life . 
on one occasion , 哈维尔 奥克塔维奥 said , &quot; if we take our vacant land -- if we put it -- some embassy what happens to give the u.s. embassy ; some to canada embassy in canada -- and if you want to rule , or american job , but they can find work , in these regions embassy work , but otherwise had to canada or american job ? &quot; 
in 2009 summer 铁血 洪都拉斯 went through a military coup . 
in the next one routine 佩佩·洛沃 elections in elections talks with reform and were promised the overwhelming advantage . 
he invited 奥克塔维奥 as his joint . 
and i was on a tedglobal . 
through a series of the improvements , a lot of users to test i try to make this charter cities complexity of the essence of compressed into the most fundamental . 
the first is , like recently made the importance of what you can &apos;t live in the households harassing already . 
new technology , but we need new technology technology and demand . 
we &apos;re usually drag these to slow us down . 
in 2010 leaves guatemala , a friend of mine sent 奥克塔维奥 this tedtalk link . 
he put it showed 哈维尔 
they call my phone 
said , &quot; let &apos;s make this show our president . &quot; 
we &apos;re in december of miami in a hotel boardrooms did . 
i try to explain the real value of these cities , and compared to the value of that &apos;s it going to be . 
i use this slide show the new york this area a piece of untapped the value of the ground . 
notice , in some point , the adjacent to thousands of dollars per square meter . 
but this is a general abstract talking about the time when some gap 奥克塔维奥 said , &quot; paul , maybe we can watch a tedtalk . &quot; 
tedtalk simple 讲明 the way that the charter cities are in an uninhabited , the charter specifying the areas of rules choose whether it &apos;s because people are living in these rules of an opportunity . 
president 洪都拉斯 questions 表态 said to me that we need to the project that &apos;s the lead this is the country . 
i was invited to visit 5日 4 , on january 特古西加尔巴 recapitulation this project . 
another including i showed this slide in the case of trying to tell this class , if you want to create a city , it had to value is huge . 
this is the picture in denver 高亮 is -- the new airports . 
it &apos;s just the airport to more than 100 square kilometers . 
i tried to convince 洪都拉斯 president if you &apos;re going to build a new city in at least you &apos;ve got to 1,000 square kilometers areas do . 
and that &apos;s bigger than 25 million acres . 
everybody &apos;s trying to control polite drum . 
the audience are serious and expressions of . 
before the conference , to say , &quot; professor ram to thank you , but maybe we can look at tedtalk . 
on my laptop now . &quot; 
and i sat down , they look at a tedtalk . 
it also gets essence was a new city , to bring people new choices . 
this is a you would go 洪都拉斯 maybe in the city of choices instead of a few hundred miles north . 
it gives leaders new choices . 
because 洪都拉斯 against the government leaders need to help the profit from 友国中 and help them make the charter of rules to make everyone will believe the charter actually get it . 
president 洛沃 crucially ability to do is to make sure that i think as a attract investment 外商 built city 洪都拉斯 experience should be and fear and doubt many different parties the same important . 
we field trips -- the area . 
this is a photograph . 
this can seat a thousand square kilometers . 
shortly after that , in january 19th they changed the constitution of congress vote for a law to support to the development of a certain areas . 
the coup just experienced in this country to congress in favor of the constitution is 124 numerous than one . 
society are different sects , all the parties to support it . 
as part of the constitution , you actually need in parliament . by twice . 
and in february 17th , 114 again than one through the act . 
after the right to vote in february 24th about 30 people 代表团 洪都拉斯 to the world in two most interested in two places . 
one is south korea . 
this is a picture of korea built going to be large , new inner-city boston -- that &apos;s bigger than science . 
you see all of the building . but they get permission to build it took four years . 
another attract architecture is singapore . 
in china they actually built two new city and prepared to build a third . 
if you think about this rationally , this is what our present . 
they have the ground , and think about it into the building cities . 
they &apos;re entering a legal program to allow administration you also have a plus legal system . 
a country has been willing to the supreme court ; for this new justice system and be eventually appeal to the court . 
this is interested in the city designers and architects . 
these even can give them some economic support . 
but one thing you know the early solve have a lot of 佃户 . 
there are many well-intentioned moved into its very moved into its seen the united states to free trade zone have a lot of people want to go there . 
the world , has 70 million people immediately permanent to think of some other places . 
100 million people a year from latin america to the united states . 
many of them away from home to look for work father -- sometimes it &apos;s single mom to make money to shelter . 
and tragically , sometimes even kids are trying to for a long time , and not seen parents are many decades , sometimes , they reunited . 
this is a vision to think about how to build a new city in 洪都拉斯 ? 
or create a new city or the world to build a few hundred a new city ? 
this is a vision to think about how every home with a number of a new households 竞争力 city ? 
this is an idea worth spreading . 
my 洪都拉斯 friend let me , thank you , ted . 
as an artist , for me is very important . 
through my art , i try to address human nature , but not isolated from every single thing is to connect with each other . 
about 10 years ago , i first went to antarctica , i first saw . 
i feel awe . 
my heart , boom , very quickly 头晕目眩 , trying to understand the in front of me , what this is . 
in my the surface of almost 200 feet . 
i just feel very strange this is a snowflake covers snowflakes , in another year . 
the iceberg when they open or breaking from the sea ice is from the shelf . 
every iceberg have their own individual personality . 
they instead of environment and the situation of interactive have a vivid . 
some of the iceberg stayed refuses to compromise , and other iceberg can &apos;t stand at passion in plumbing radical happened when the ice is water . 
when you see ice , it &apos;s easy to think that -- they were isolated , they are independent , solo , more like we humans , sometimes for themselves . 
but the reality is far more than this . 
as ice melts , my breath old to it . 
as ice melts , it released a rich mineral the frozen water they all the things . 
i started to shoot these iceberg like i was taken the portraits , i learned in these at that moment was the way to look like that , but doesn &apos;t exist . 
when they melts , this is not dead ; it &apos;s not an end , but don &apos;t die out the path to a forth . 
i photographed , some of the ice is very young age -- thousands of years . 
some ice more than 10 million years . 
i want to show you the last picture i took the Kekertsuatsiak in greenland in one of the iceberg . 
this is a pretty incredible opportunity to see you actually rolls under an iceberg . 
so this is just pictured right here . 
on the left you can see a boat . 
this is a about 15 feet boat . 
i want you to notice the shape of the iceberg it on top of the water distorted . 
here you see it rolls under , little to move to the side , a man standing there . 
this is an average size of the greenland ice . 
it &apos;s the surface is about 120 feet tall or 40 feet tall . 
it &apos;s real time . 
like this iceberg , they show you is the personality of different ways . 
thank you . 
i want you to imagine in 1979 , two couple of years in the same day , every to the same time with a child -- 
so two couple 都都 as a child with 
now , i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time to imagine pregnant because if you spend too much time to think of it , you would listen to me . 
so imagine a little bit . 
so in this case i &apos;m going to imagine a example is carrying y chromosomes met sperm egg , carrying x chromosome . 
the other one is carrying x chromosome met the sperm egg , carrying x chromosome . 
two were alive , two are starting to develop 
we then look at these two couple . 
i took two roles i &apos;ve been working on . 
i do a role is anatomy historical research 
i was a 史学 workers what i study how they treat humans are both the anatomical -- for human body , or animals -- they do with body , abstract outside the body fluids how they see outside . 
another character was a social activists as a patient 辩护人 role -- or , as i said , as doctors 辩护人 patient -- i &apos;m really radical 
, i work in touch is some of these challenges social norms . 
for instance , i encounter 连体 babies are two people in a physical 
and some are also , dementia than the average person to small more 
i was exposed to a lot of other people , their gender different -- they don &apos;t have a standard men and women characteristics of the body . 
basically , the symptoms of sexual people can be called 
double sex can have multiple . 
let me give you a few examples on you can have both men &apos;s not the standard . it &apos;s not the standard of women . 
one example of a person can have XY chromosomes and , in the y chromosome on genetic males SRY gender and i decided to stimulate the genes , we found in a period of the original 性腺 make it into the testes 
so , the testes , and in the testes hormones . 
but the individual missing to harvest the testes hormone receptor body can &apos;t respond to the testes hormones . 
this is something called the testes &apos;t sensitive testes feminine syndrome . 
so , instead of hormones big , but not to . 
so , would be feminine trend . 
when the baby , she looks like a girls . 
she was girls as a young girl , and to raise 
most of the situation , until adolescence her chest age , she had no woman 性周期 and we started suspecting go wrong ? 
and so they don &apos;t check found her ovaries , and in fact , in her body in the womb have the testes , and she carries the y chromosome . 
now , there &apos;s an important question need to say is that you have to think this is actually a boys and girls who actually . 
men and women , as an organ &apos;s called 肾上腺 
it &apos;s in our body and 
and converts 肾上腺 and that &apos;s a male hormone 
most women like me -- i believe that i was a typical women -- i don &apos;t know my genome of the components but i think i probably have a typical women like me -- most of the women &apos;s actually a male hormone sensitive 
we made testosterone , and will respond to it 
it turns out , and women , like me to the brain of testosterone the testes are born with than that girl that testosterone &apos;t sensitive syndrome girl have testosterone more 
so , gender is a very complex things ; it &apos;s not like the double the people in men and women -- in some ways , they can cover the whole range of sex . 
here &apos;s another example of a few years ago , i received a 19 years old boy the phone he was born with a boy , also known as a boy to have happened , but with your girlfriend girlfriend has happened with their sex life but recently , and he &apos;s found myself in the womb ovaries 
all of his is a very extreme conditions enzyme called steroids 21- 羟 deficit disorder . 
he &apos;s carrying a first-name basis in utero chromosomes and he of very active to form a male hormone . 
as a result , he develop the men in his brain reproductive organs to the typical more male hormone 
so he birth to look like a boys and girls -- there &apos;s no doubt 
only when he to 19 , when he started with biological problem is actually came up inside their doctor , he actually interior is women 
well , we &apos;ll to an example of another can bring the gender . 
we have a first-name basis some people will develop a species called eggs 睾 organs when ovaries , organized by the testes organization on a kind of organs . 
we &apos;re not sure it causes 
so , gender can is not defined in one form 
physical traits have these kids -- whether it &apos;s also , or 连体 baby or &apos;s a sexual the surgeon surgery -- was actually put the reason not to physical health . 
because many cases , they &apos;re very healthy 
they all kinds of surgery , and the reason is because they are in our society for a threat . 
or social have a typical know what , what is the structures . 
so , the idea is that is a woman had to have women , and that would have to have a black africans in your body 结构特征 catalogue . 
so we have to recognize that &apos;s too simple . 
when we &apos;re dealing with a certain aspect is different from the body can &apos;t we sort of ideas . 
so our culture is a lot of being about individualism . 
and we countries based on a very real individualism concept . 
well , you can imagine how astonishing that when you two kids was born in a body . 
i recently this is a time when africa last year , he 卡斯特尔·塞 track athletes , the international a game in berlin has been gender . 
a lot of journalists call me , &quot; they will ask me to test which is to tell you that 卡斯特尔·塞门亚 men and women ? &quot; 
so i have to explain to them , there was no way to test . 
in fact , we &apos;ve now about gender &apos;s very complicated we have to admit that nature didn &apos;t get a clear to distinguish between men and women and men and women and pair of sex and the sexual this is actually we draw . 
and so we now is the more developed science as we have to admit that these gender , which is a form of course , we think of structures are too simple give it the case that we know more ambiguous . 
and this is not just about gender . 
it &apos;s also the complexity of questions about race far we &apos;re not the language to describe the academic 
as we can see , we are all kinds of difficult . 
let &apos;s an example , the reality is that we use 95 percent of the human dna with gorilla compare 
to the truth is that humans and gorilla in the dna , just in a different way . 
the more developed the technology we &apos;re talking about to persistent , we have to admit that are simple are too simplistic 
and that &apos;s why we &apos;re looked at all human life . 
one of those , for example , which is our culture , in the field of cultural area on the hot end of the origin of life and 
we have a difficult when we talk about from a body became a human to have a different from the power of the fetus . 
we now have a very controversial topics -- maybe not in the outside of debate in medicine -- is for people to think about questions . 
the past , people have died , our ancestors never would have too much of it . 
the more is a stick feathers the nose , if you move feathers hateful , they would not just the ground . 
if you don &apos;t move feathers , they buried . 
but now we also we wanted to transplant organs to other people &apos;s body . 
and we started talking about the struggle on about what the problem of dead no 
this makes us into a very difficult the simple , we don &apos;t have before . 
now , you might think , all of these are the same may make people like me happy 
i was a political perspective on , i kept progress of the amount of the body , but i must admit , it made me feel insecure . 
realized that these institutions than we think it &apos;s unstable , i feel nervous . 
meanwhile , my nervous from democracy . 
so , in order to tell you how this was the first thing i have to admit , i was ♫ founding fathers biggest fan 
i know they &apos;re racism , they were men the top is , but they &apos;re very great 
i mean , they are so heroic and positive , the fearless one of my own in every year to appreciate that was going in the united states , &quot; &quot; by 1776 建国 history not by the music , music is good because it can be completely ignored . 
because who around 1776 -- 建国 happening 
the 建国 , i think they were the anatomy activists this is what i love them . 
they got the idea of a anatomy and with another instead of this new into good idea to 200 years . 
you think about our 建国 who is the idea of a 君主 rules . 
and the monarchy is based on an oversimplification of the anatomy . 
the old system monarch didn &apos;t dna concept , but they following &quot; where is the idea of &quot; 
they have privileged . 
they think , in political power of people should have power from an privileged because my father to son from one generation 
who 建国 against this point in a new dissect idea that instead of people are equal . 
they get those ideas and sure anatomy is equal importance of something rather than where dignity . 
and at the time , it &apos;s a very radical reform . 
some extent , this reform still in because they are part of the enlightenment system is two things together . 
democracy , but it was also being formed in technology . 
very robust is , if you look 建国 history of the many of them are very interested in science and they all about naturalism and , very interested in the world . 
they dismiss the paranormal them about the power from the paranormal , because the paranormal the concept is the power to be very blurry 身世 based on the idea of 
they say , the concept of naturalism 
if you look at that the declaration of independence , for example , in their nature and nature to god . 
they didn &apos;t mention god and the nature of god . 
they mentioned the power of nature to explain who we are 
so as part of a concept of them for us is that people are equal 
so they did for the future of the civil rights movement had a wonderful . 
they want to be , but they love affair the foundation for us , this is great 
so a few years , what happened ? 
for example , in women &apos;s happening in their right to vote 建国 concept of the people in the far more important to of where they said , &quot; we have in the womb is the ovaries , and all these different voting didn &apos;t mean that we don &apos;t have enough of citizen rights no private property rights etc . &quot; 
women have shown that cause . 
what is the movement of the civil rights movement 索杰纳·特鲁思 that people like her , &quot; i &apos;m not a woman ? &quot; 
we know that men in the civil rights movement was there on the route quote , &quot; i &apos;m a men . &quot; 
moreover , people to people and to racism and furthermore , and not 
we can see the same success 伤残 people in the case of rights movement 
the question is , of course , when we started to look at all the citizens question we have to start thinking about why we to maintain a fixed boundaries 
now , to remind you that i want to keep some boundaries structures , in our culture is within range 
for example , i don &apos;t want to give a fish and human rights . 
i don &apos;t want us to give up in the boundaries between anatomic 
i don &apos;t hope , a five-year-old children can be allowed to have sex or married 
so , some in anatomic boundaries for us is meaningful , i think that should be kept 
but , daunting task is try to figure out which is why we should be kept going to keep them , they have make any sense . 
so , let &apos;s go back to just say that two people to talk about what is a kind of the two people 
we have two couple of years in 1979 the pregnant . 
let &apos;s imagine , mary have three months born so she was born in 1980 , june 1日 
henry , instead , he was born in a month in 1980 1日 march . 
just because mary early born three months of the fact that was the right time to 比亨利 early three months to have sex , the power of the voting rights , drink . 
henry you have to wait for his physiology the same age without any not just because he was born in the same time . 
we also found other things right . 
henry , because that was for men -- even though i didn &apos;t tell much too large family , he was XY chromosomes -- because that was so now , for men 应征 入伍 mary don &apos;t need to worry about these 
meanwhile , mary can &apos;t all enjoy the same state like henry same rights which is , married . 
henry could get a state in any but mary now can only a few state married a woman 
so what we are some of them structurally , in many ways , it &apos;s a problem and need to questioning 
for me , the problem just becomes : we &apos;re going to do when we science anatomically so advanced , we have to have to admit based on anatomic people may collapse in democracy . 
i don &apos;t want to lose hope for science , but also , sometimes sort of think that science is by we can influence . 
so we going to lead ? 
which we have a utilitarian attitude , &quot; well , i have to draw a line in somewhere , so i &apos;d like to draw a line that &quot; 
but a lot of people so in a very awkward position 
for example , texas , there &apos;s a decided to marry a man means that you didn &apos;t have the y chromosome and if you marry a woman means you have the y chromosome 
in reality , they actually not going to test the chromosomes . 
but it also very surprising , because i started to tell you about the male hormone &apos;t sensitive syndrome . 
if we look at modern democracy one of the founder of dr. martin luther king did in his &quot; i have a dream &quot; , we have a solution . 
he think we should not based on a human skin pigmentation , but he was incredible qualities to read a people , &quot; stop there . 
i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds really is a good idea . &quot; 
but in fact , what do you do ? 
his 品德 you how to read him ? 
i want to say , i don &apos;t quite sure how we should distribution of human rights , because i have to admit , some of the gold 猎犬 than i know some people seem to have to get social help 
i want to say , i know that there seems to be 40 拉布拉多 than some of the people in the more sex be smarter , more , more mature make decisions . 
so how are we going to measure 品德 the problem ? 
it turns out that &apos;s very difficult 
i want to know if 品德 in the future of good and can be scan -- maybe you could use mri see ? 
we really want to go to the next step ? 
i &apos;m not sure we going to lead 
i know what the united states is to lead to think about the problems of democracy looks very important . 
we &apos;re for democracy in &apos;ve done very well , i think the next will also do better 
we and iran , like a man in sexual for other men attractive so he was killed can change your unless he &apos;d come so he will be able to survive 
we don &apos;t have that . 
i &apos;m very pleased to say we &apos;re not going to be able to do that -- for a surgeon said , that &apos;s a few years before he brought a 连体 want to help their babies , sort of want their famous 
but when i told him telephone call when asked him why want to do this surgery -- because this is a dangerous very high surgery -- he said , in this country that will be cruel , so he had to help them to do this . 
and he said , &quot; well , you think about political shelter for them , instead of surgery ? &quot; 
the united states like this child keep their own signature cleared possible , they don &apos;t use for national change its body 
so i think we should all those ideas lead 
okay , so , i want to remind you , i &apos;ve talked a lot of 前人 . 
i want to think about democracy what that would be like , or have the possibility of what if we can make more mother to be involved . 
i want to say to a feminist a little bit radical , which is that i think you could probably a different view of and especially when we &apos;re used to thinking of the learns 
i &apos;ve of sexual people interested in many years and gender difference years of research . 
i &apos;m very interested in is one of the things to see the world , between men and women are thinking about the problem with the problem . 
we know from cross-cultural in women , the average -- of course not everybody , but the average -- tend to be more and more complex social care about , the disadvantaged of compassion in the population . 
so if we think we find an interesting . 
a few years ago , when i read graduate student . and one of my professors feminist movement that i was interested in is -- i was a feminist , is -- and he asked me a very strange . 
he said , &quot; tell me where feminine feminist 
and i thought , &quot; well ... this is what i heard my mouth 无言 smelled the problem . 
feminism is all banal gender gaps , everything &apos;s perception of activity , and therefore , feminine feminist &apos;t exist . &quot; 
but to read this question , i think more , maybe there &apos;s some feminine feminist 
so , maybe some , 总的说来 different than men and women of thinking that we 警惕性 richer and more complex social for the disadvantaged of attention 
but before 细心 protect the people that &apos;s how the individual countries if we are in this idea of injecting as more maternal is possible , we &apos;re going to have much more than a concept , but it &apos;s not just how to take care of each other how to protect 
maybe that &apos;s our future to when we get away from the path of all that to talk about democracy -- which is less about the individuals to people about identity , but more about the relationship between people 
so , when people trying to create a much better colossal , we need to think about is that we are doing what others . 
thank you . 
when you imagine a big bang in the air , 3,000 呎 
imagine cage with black smoke . 
imagine a achilles engine , achilles , achilles , achilles , on the sound . 
this sound . 
the other day , i position , i was sitting in a very special 1D 
and i was the only person in a vacuum . 
so i look at them and they said , &quot; okay , we should just hitting a bird . &quot; 
机长 机头 from the very close to our destination 
already you can see the manhattan . 
two minutes later three things that happen 
the is lined ha , 机长 lost . 
this is not normal lanes 
he closes the engine 
imagine a plane , there &apos;s no . 
and he said , a few words i heard the emotional with a few words . 
he said , &quot; are 迫降 shock , be careful . &quot; 
i don &apos;t have to ask a part of empty . 
i can see from her life of fear . 
now i want to share with you what i learned that day three things 
the moment , everything changed . 
our personal goal list that we want to do all those i want to address book didn &apos;t address book , who i should fixing the fence , relationships all i want to experience , no experience . 
and i think i think the thing that &apos;s a collection of wine , &quot; i have a very bad . &quot; 
because if you &apos;re already maturity , there are also , i : pour it open . 
i don &apos;t want to put anything after 延 
the purpose that changed my life . 
what i learned the second thing is , as we by george washington bridge and that &apos;s not long i thought , wow , i have a truly regret . 
although i made some . 
but my life and i actually try and put everything do better . 
but because humanity i we have some egocentric 
regret i actually spent a lot of time and life important people who don &apos;t important thing about 
and i thought about my wife , and friends and people . 
later , i think this thing that i decided to get rid of my life , the negative emotions 
still haven &apos;t do it , but better . 
the last two years , my wife and i never 吵架 
and it &apos;s great . 
i don &apos;t try argument i chose happiness . 
what i learned the third thing when your brain the clock to calculate backwards &quot; 14 , 15 , 13 &quot; 
next to see the water . 
i &apos;m like , &quot; please explosion . &quot; 
i don &apos;t think it breaks down into something like 20 of that documentary . 
when we feel sink , and suddenly i didn &apos;t die , wow . 
it &apos;s like we &apos;ve been to prepare for it . 
but it &apos;s sad 
i don &apos;t want to leave that , i love my life . 
this is the main thing i just look forward to a 
i hope i grew up to be able to see my children . 
and a month later , i show a year -- her daughter , no art day ... ... 
so even ... ... 
i like a child tears 
let me the world to have meaning 
and i realized that put these two things even actually my life is only important thing to be a good father 
important than anything in my life in the goal is to make a good father 
the other day , i went through a miracles , i survive . 
and i get another lesson like saw their future back change your life . 
i encourage you to imagine the plane if the same thing in your body -- you don &apos;t -- but like , you &apos;re going to change ? 
there &apos;s anything you want to do because they don &apos;t do you think you &apos;ll have other the opportunity to do it ? 
how would you change your relationships not so negative ? 
most importantly , if you try to be a good parents ? 
thank you . 
the idea behind the computer worms was very simple . 
we didn &apos;t want to iran have nuclear weapons . 
they use in the developed nuclear weapons device is concentrated 纳坦兹 uranium . 
you see on the box is real-time control system . 
if we manage to evade the speed and these 控制驱动器 valve system , we can actually use a centrifuge a lot of problems . 
this can &apos;t run windows box on ; they use software is completely different . 
but if we manage a windows viruses to engineer a device for placed on this box laptop , and then we can start acting . 
this is the virus behind the conspiracy . 
so i started this from a windows into . 
it spread to carry on the box , destroying centrifuge , iran nuclear program delay -- mission accomplished . 
easy , right ? 
i want to tell you how we find these . 
six months ago when we started working on the web , we have a virus that the purpose of it . 
the only know , it &apos;s part of windows , into a very , very complex , multiple 零日 gaps . 
it seemed to want to these up in the box , the control systems do . 
and it our lab , we started a program with the web , infected with our system , and the careful . 
and then some very interesting things happened . 
the web of viruses like just don &apos;t like cheese big white rats -- smelling a cheese , but he didn &apos;t want to eat . 
i don &apos;t understand . 
and in our experiments all sorts of different cheese later , i realized that this is a fixed attacks . 
it &apos;s totally fixed . 
if you find a certain configuration is active , insert on a dive in a box , even though it &apos;s trying to the actual process and doing the same thing . 
if you don &apos;t find the goal , the virus do nothing . 
this is my attention to the day , we started to the study , because i think we don &apos;t know what &apos;s the goal . 
the goal is perhaps , for example , the chemical plant , or germany . 
so we better quickly figure out what &apos;s the goal . 
we take the code and 反编译 attack , it has two numbers bombs -- a smaller and a bigger . 
and we also found that they were all 内幕 understand information to make very professional . 
they know what to the all the details . 
they even know the operator shoe numbers . 
they know everything . 
if you &apos;ve heard about , the web into the virus is a complex and high-tech , let me tell you : it &apos;s very complicated the virus . 
this more than we &apos;ve seen technology . 
here you can actually see the attacks of the code . 
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 right code . 
looks like the 汇编语言 . 
i want to tell you how we understand the code . 
the first one that we &apos;re looking for is a system up these distributions , because we know what to do . 
and then we need to find 定时器 and data structures , and then try and bring them and real world -- potentially to connect with the goal is to connect the real world . 
so we need to target theory we can use it to prove it or not . 
in order to get goal theory , we remember it causes severe , so to have a very high-value targets , and it &apos;s probably already in iran , because in iran , the more the virus . 
in this area don &apos;t find a lot of goal . 
could basically to shrink 布歇赫尔 lot to concentrate and 纳坦兹 uranium mill . 
so i said to my assistant , &quot; give me a centrifuge all of our 客户群 and plants experts list . &quot; 
i spoke to the phone , and they come to spend their expertise to analyze the data in code , and we found . 
it &apos;s really work . 
we can move this little numerical 弹头 up with rotor controller . 
this is a centrifuge inside of rotor 机件 movement , which is that you see the black object . 
if this is actually the speed of rotor , and eventually decode rotor can even get centrifuge bang . 
we also see the attack is this very scary thing slowly -- obviously it &apos;s going to maintain the engineers , very quickly , they couldn &apos;t figure out a problem . 
large numbers 弹头 -- by closely at the data and data structures , we have the opportunity to know something about . 
for example , the digital code in these 164 very compelling ; you can &apos;t ignore it . 
i started studying with these 分离机 纳坦兹 about how to build in scientific literature , and in that they were known as a level that contain 164 , every level of a centrifuge . 
it &apos;s a little bit of a clear , match up . 
match even better . 
in iran these centrifuge is divided into 15 so-called &#93; . 
guess we found in attack code ? 
a &#93; almost exactly the same structure . 
so , again , very best matches up . 
what we do this job gave us a lot more confidence . 
now don &apos;t get me wrong , it &apos;s not like this . 
these results includes us several weeks hard work . 
we often go into dead and go back to the starting point . 
anyway , we find these two in different directions that digital 弹头 affirming one goal . 
little 弹头 choose a level , the speed , and then that rotor they slow down , and 弹头 six relate to manipulate and valves . 
basically , we very confident the goal is what we know . 
it &apos;s 纳坦兹 , may just be 纳坦兹 . 
we don &apos;t worry about the potential to attack the virus . 
some of them we see very cool stuff -- really shocked me . 
here is on the box , saw in a centrifuge . 
so here &apos;s the thing , it sends head off from sensor is the input -- for example , from the pressure sensors and the vibrational sensors -- , providing input is legal code , in this code kept running the attacks , there &apos;s a code of input data . 
in fact , this false input data is the web of virus advance . 
as a clip from hollywood movies , the camera is linked in the advance , canned video . 
really cool , isn &apos;t it ? 
it was obviously not stupid control room to the operator . 
it &apos;s actually more dangerous , more aggressive . 
it &apos;s going to circumvent digital security system . 
we need to digital human security system in the operator can &apos;t make the action of fast enough . 
for example , in plants , when a huge steam angle 轮机 fast , in the open 安全阀 in a millisecond . 
obviously , human operator not possible . 
so , here you have to digital security system . 
and when they break it , the real question . 
plant explodes . 
and security systems are not going to notice . 
this is horrible . 
but i &apos;ll even worse . 
i &apos;m going to say , very important . 
think about this . 
this attack is universal . 
it doesn &apos;t need to uranium centrifuge , concentrating do specific thing . 
it will , for example , in a power plant or a car 制造厂 . 
it &apos;s very common . 
as a 攻击者 , you don &apos;t need -- it &apos;s not needed to put it on u , as we spread out in the net virus see this case . 
you can also use the traditional worms technology for transmission . 
the most widely spread it . 
and ultimately , if you &apos;re going to have a cyber weapons of mass destruction . 
this is what we have to deal with . 
unfortunately , this is the largest number of attacks the goal is not in the middle east . 
but in the united states , europe and japan . 
all these green area , these are the goal dense . 
we have to deal with that the consequences , we &apos;d better immediately started . 
thank you . 
chris anderson : i have a problem . 
ralph , widely how people think 摩萨德 主使 is invisible . 
how do you see ? 
拉尔夫·兰纳 : okay , you really want to know ? 
yeah , ok . 
i think there are 摩萨德 , but the dominant force is not in israel . 
the dominant force on the internet superpower . 
there &apos;s only one , which is the united states -- fortunately , very lucky . 
because otherwise , we have the problem worse . 
ca : thank you us a big jump , thank you , ralph . 
i had the privilege of life in a lot of amazing . 
but did the coolest projects with this guy . 
this game name is TEMPT . 
TEMPT graffiti artist is one of the early &apos; 80s . 
one day he ran step back home , he said , &quot; daddy , i have some 发麻 legs . &quot; 
this is ALS the beginning of the symptoms . 
TEMPT now was completely paralyzed . 
can only his eyes . 
i &apos;ve been exposed with him . 
i have to do this design and animation company , we obviously doodling is in the art world in a complex admired and respect . 
so , we decided to become tony , which is , of TEMPT sponsor . 
so i went to find his brother and his father said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you some money . 
you going to do ? &quot; 
his brother said , &quot; i just want to be able to and tony . 
can i just wanted to communicate with him , and he can communicate with me . &quot; 
i said , &quot; wait a minute , i have seen , stephen hawking , &quot; not all the people can communicate with people with these devices ? 
and he said , &quot; no , unless it is the social , &quot; have very amazing how well , or don &apos;t do . 
and these devices are not that easy to get . &quot; 
i said , &quot; well , how do you communicate ? &quot; 
have you haven &apos;t seen the movie &quot; diving minutes and butterflies ? &quot; 
that &apos;s where they communicate -- moving their fingers . 
i said , &quot; this idea behind it . how could that be ? &quot; 
i wish just opened the check , instead , i started a i didn &apos;t know how to check true . 
i was to his brother -- and the promise and his father was , &quot; okay , well , tony &apos;s going to be able to speak , we &apos;ll give him a machine , we will find a he could do it again . 
because that &apos;s a normal people intrinsic still can &apos;t communicate is it &apos;s absurd . &quot; 
a few months later i was in a meeting have a talk . 
i met these are called GRL guy , the doodle research lab Graffiti research lab , and they have a technology can get them to a ray of 光投射 to any surface , and then with a 激光笔 painting on top , and it will form a dark gap . 
they &apos;ll walk around , like to show that art . 
all these things , they call a life cycle . 
first , and in 性器官 脏话 slandered , and then there &apos;s george bush , and then people see art . 
but they always what a life cycle . 
i was back home with my wife , when the dinner , and told her , &quot; etc . , if we knew that this technology could control with your eyes , why we don &apos;t want to a way to get a laser beam TEMPT to control , and he was able to do a doodle again , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot; 
and so we started to action . 
about two years later , by a year later , in many organizations and some we change the way we had done something . 
the first , we could make the insurance industry , we really gave TEMPT a machine he can communicate stephen hawking -- one of the machine . 
that &apos;s fantastic . 
he &apos;s really the most interesting people -- and i called 他尤达 , because you said to him , he gave you send Email , hi like to think , &quot; i have no . this guy &apos;s good . &quot; 
we do the other thing is , we took seven from the programmers -- literally , they come from every corner of the world -- they come together we here . 
my wife and children and i moved to the back of the garage , these guys , programmers , conspiracy an adventist and anarchists over our house . 
a lot of friends , we think we did it &apos;s too silly we back to the house of the image is going to hang out , and the wall would be the crap . 
but after two weeks later , we have two weeks later , we went to venice street , in my children , and my dog &apos;s involved , we built this . 
we call 书写器 EyeWriter eye , and you can look at this . 
it &apos;s a cheap sunglasses we buy in venice , some of the waterfront 铜线 and some from home and Radio three-decade Shack and to sell the appliance franchise buy things . 
we got a camera , them PS3 it , put it in a led , now , this device is free -- you can make , we opened the source code , you can download it for free . 
now we can &apos;t do to make this a device . 
no insurance companies can say , &quot; no . &quot; 
don &apos;t have any hospital can say , &quot; no . &quot; 
now any the can only use their eyes can paintings and communicating . 
thank you . 
and thank you very much . it &apos;s great . 
in the end of the two weeks later , we went back to TEMPT room . 
i love this picture , because this is the other room this is his room . 
all these crowded 喧嚷 for this is a major moment . 
over a year in the program , two weeks , fast food and 通宵 meeting , tony in seven years later , the first started painting . 
this is a painting amazing graphics , because this is his life support system , he was look at his life support system . 
we shake up his bed , he can see . 
we raised a projector , in his hospital side of the parking lot of the wall . 
again , he started drawing , in front of his family and friends -- you can imagine what &apos;s going on in parking lots . 
interestingly , we should also in the parking , then we feel like we are part of the doodle . 
in this the end , he gave us a letter Email , one of these words : &quot; this is my seventh to my first to be able to make paintings . 
i think i &apos;ve been in underwater , and finally somebody reach out a hand to pull out my head , that i could breathe . &quot; 
this is great , right . 
it &apos;s a little bit like our own slogan . 
this is we &apos;re going . 
we walked so long way to do it . 
this is a fantastic device , but it with sketchy 刻蚀 different . 
you have a potential that art should get more . 
we also in the process of discovery , exploring how to make it better , more quickly , more powerful . 
and then , we got all sorts of . 
we got a lot of reward . 
remember , it &apos;s free ; none of us in use this thing to make a penny . 
all of that if we are . 
we reward is , &quot; oh , this is kickin . &quot; 
armstrong throve about our twitter , and then in december , 2010 time magazine gave us the big inventions 50 , it &apos;s really cool . 
the coolest thing -- it &apos;s going to do is -- this cycle in april , in downtown l.a. 芬 of the contemporary 艺术馆 , will have a called &quot; &quot; 展览会 street art . 
&quot; and &quot; street art many street art class , bad robot -- 克斯 谢帕德·费尔雷 , CAW -- all these people are . 
it will be in TEMPT of fair , it &apos;s very good . 
so basically my idea is : if you see some not impossible , to make it possible . 
all happened in this room is impossible -- this stage , this computer , and this , by making a 书写器 -- this is impossible . 
is this room , and everyone make it possible . 
i don &apos;t be programmers , never done anything to identify the eye movement of technology , but i just think about something , and myself and some of the people that we can the whole of 名堂 . 
that &apos;s what i want everybody in every day , when you think about things that you should do , all ask ourselves . 
and if we don &apos;t do it , that when they do ? what if i don &apos;t do that , who &apos;s going to do ? 
thank you . 
i &apos;ve just come from a community that they had human survival of the secret . 
in this community , women , the dominant love to do was said something , the sound of play is all 法宝 正经 -- happiness is a serious play . 
no , it doesn &apos;t mean you fire burning of the men don &apos;t mean san francisco and which means multicultural . 
ladies and gentlemen , meet your close . 
this is the wild 倭 座落 chimpanzees in the world , in the congo . 
chimpanzees are the bonobos are we live in the most closely related to close . 
it means that we all with a common ancestor , an evolutionary the grandmother , she lived in about 6百 million years ago . 
now , the chimpanzees for their 好战 and famous . 
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve emphasis on human evolution that the role of history . 
but that 倭 chimpanzees for us is that the other side of the coin . 
when chimpanzees were big , scary males chimpanzees complexes 倭 chimpanzees , community is leading 倭 chimpanzees by females . 
these chimpanzees can become 倭 to live together , thereby formed a highly tolerant . society in this community , lethal violence haven &apos;t been observed . 
but unfortunately , is an australopithecine like lucy 倭 chimpanzees the most difficult to understand . 
they live in the depth of the congo , so it &apos;s very hard to research . 
congo is a dilemma , this is the paradox , tension -- she &apos;s a piece of incubation extraordinary biodiversity and beautiful land , but she &apos;s also darkness of violence -- on a few decades it robs a lot of life as the first world war . 
不足为奇 destruction , this is also 危及 倭 chimpanzees . 
our hunting and the bush meat , and that means we can &apos;t go to the only in the world a little 倭 the chimpanzee habitat -- to be honest , we can &apos;t even sure if there &apos;s a little . 
and yet , in this is violence and chaotic land you can hear 隐隐约约 -- swaying stacks in the trees . 
these animals are close what ? 
&quot; do we know they &apos;re not going to war , &quot; love , so they have more , it &apos;s kind of sex and double sexual sex to deal with their conflicts and social problems . 
now i &apos;m not saying this is all human -- because of the problem for 倭 play by chimpanzees desire for more than that . 
倭 chimpanzees as human beings , in their entire life all love to play . 
it &apos;s not just kids play games . 
for us humans and 倭 chimpanzees , play is create intimacy and nurture 容忍性 . 
it also we learn to trust and games rules 
a play a euphoric creativity and adaptability , it &apos;s all about diversity of diversity , diversity -- the interaction of behavior , and diversity . 
and when you look at play 倭 chimpanzees , you &apos;ll see very evolutionary roots humans -- , dancing and rituals . 
that &apos;s where we play 粘结 connected to each other . 
but now i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you one was taken in the wild to montage . 
first of all , this is a game of 球类 倭 chimpanzees -- i don &apos;t mean football . 
here , two young a female 倭 a male chimpanzee playing chasing game . 
look at what she was doing . 
this is probably the phrase &quot; she was in his 蛋蛋 . &quot; the origin of evolution . 
i just think of him rather like this , right . 
yes . 
so , in the bonobos are game on both humans are quotidian experience . 
and this is a video that &apos;s really interesting because it turns out -- the video &apos;s really interesting because it turns out that the unusual in the game of the amount of creative game -- like the testes -- how can we trust and nurture trust -- for the future and fun . 
but the tangles that play is a process . 
play is a distorted process ; it can become a lot of play games , some games are more quiet , imaginative , 求索 to play -- maybe this wonderful find new . 
i want you to see , it &apos;s hunky 倭 female cool , a young chimpanzees , she was anything dramatic had to play water . 
i think , like her , we sometimes alone , we explore play with the outside world inside us and our the boundaries . 
it &apos;s fun of novelty drives us to explore , to interact with us . 
and then we the unexpected this is really in the connection of creativity . 
so that it &apos;s light , it gives us by 倭 chimpanzees this deep insights to explore our past and present . 
but they also for our future we have a secret , in the future we need to adapt to get a very challenging with the world , more creative and more to do it . 
this secret is have the ability to play is the key . 
in other words , we used to play is the future of the cards . 
for success to a change in the world , we need to play . 
but we &apos;re going to play as playful ? 
play ; play is not insignificant . 
for the bonobos are human , life is not just an interest in the teeth and claws . 
if the appropriate to play , but it &apos;s probably the most desperately need to play . 
well , my fellow primates , let &apos;s recognized the evolution of this muse-like playful let &apos;s play a gift that we can see the relationship 情同手足 creativity , and wonder . 
thank you . 
i want you now imagine a can wear robot , it can give you a superman wheelchair users , or to stand up again . 
we in berkeley bio-morphic technology company called 外骨骼 these robots . 
you don &apos;t have any other things in the morning after it gives you the power of extra up even higher , and it &apos;s going to you , it will help you , for example , control balance . 
in fact , it really put people and machines . 
but not only that -- and it &apos;s going to put together , and you connect to other machine . 
this is not just some reinventing imagination . 
in order to demonstrate to you in our current work , we &apos;re going to talk about american soldiers , they can put on the back about 100 pounds of weight , and being asked to carry more . 
obviously , it causes some 并发 of problems -- 30 percent of the soldiers have chronic back injury -- the damage . 
so we think we should look at this challenge to create a 外骨骼 solve this problem . 
so now let me introduce HULC -- it &apos;s a human payloads 外骨骼 . 
soldier : took HULC 外骨骼 later , i can carry 200 pounds of the terrain . in a complicated walking many hours . 
it can make people in deep crouched , 匍匐 move forward and high flexibility . 
it feels the i want to do , is where , and then my power and the endurance element . 
艾瑟·本德 : we partner with our industry and ready to introduce this device , this year in this new 外骨骼 . 
it &apos;s true . 
now let &apos;s pull away to wheelchair users , this is my personal very passionate about . 
there &apos;s the world 6千8百 million wheelchair users . 
one of the population is about . 
this is a conservative . 
we &apos;re going to say that there are spinal cord injury very young people in 年富力强 -- 20 , 30 , 40 years old -- did it &apos;s a wheelchair &apos;s the only choice . 
and the population aging also makes it a digital exponential growth . 
and the only choice , the basic -- when people with a stroke , or other conditions -- is wheelchair . 
in fact , the last 500 years , this is very successful , i must say . 
so , i think we should start to write a new era of mobility . 
now let me introduce eLEGS in 波斯特 is so amanda , over 19 years ago , she was a spine damage , and she came to my can &apos;t walk , until now . 
so amanda , 波斯特 : thank you . 
it was rather : i said , amanda wearing is our eLEGS . 
it has sensors -- 
in these hold within the sensors , to be very unmusical signaling infiltrated them to fit in her 机载 the computer . 
but there was a 电池组 in her hips , the motors , including she 膝关节 power of the motors , so she can smooth natural pace . 
so amanda , my age 24 pinnacle of life , my 不慎 skiing up and fall down , i really paralyzed . 
in that moment , i lost all these little feeling and activity . 
and pretty soon , a doctor walked into my patient , i said , &quot; so amanda , you couldn &apos;t walk . &quot; 
that &apos;s over 19 years ago . 
he &apos;s taken me every hope . 
adaptive technology once again , for me to learn how to ski , climbing up and down , even 手动 bicycle . 
but nothing invention i was walking , until now . 
thank you . 
it was rather : as you can see , we have the technology , we have to sit down , and you about this . 
it &apos;s in our hands , we have all the potential offspring , to change our lives -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda and all the wheelchair users , but for everyone . 
so amanda : thank you . 
in new york , i was &quot; 罗宾汉 &quot; mobile phone operators the director of development . 
so in my eradicate poverty , and i &apos;m putting it out i was living conductor of volunteer fire 
in our little town in a successful people who are the places where you have to be very early to live to be joined 战况 
i remember the first fire 
i was a second to live of volunteers you can get into hoses were probably 
but you also have to run win other volunteers to find what you see him 
when i see he was a rapt 好不容易 find the house and the main talk about her life is obviously a bad day at the 
she was a big standing in the shirt , and in 滂沱大雨 barefoot , after the umbrella her house is burning 熊熊 
another than i want to step of volunteers &apos;ll call him Lex Luther of superman and the pie so just to see around us , he was assigned to kill the hoses were to save house into little dogs 
little dogs hey ! i envy died . 
the lawyers or financial manager tenured can tell someone he into a living hoses were a little dog because he than i could to five seconds 
well , let me hobbyhorse . 
i see called 
he said , &quot; bezos , i need you kill hoses were into 
i need you to the floor , cross fire i need you to take this lady pair of shoes . &quot; 
is it really , i swear . 
this is not my heart of images , but i went to the floor , go through the hallway , &quot; really &quot; the firemen they &apos;ve put out the fire and i walked into the master bedroom , took a pair of shoes . 
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero 
i put my task with downstairs in five seconds i met the front of a man and his the dog 
we brought our 宝藏 unsurprisingly , the front , and he &apos;s getting more than my attention 
a few weeks later , we get from the department of the house of a letter thank you . we save 她家 force of behavior 
she focus on a modest for her detail and grab a pair of shoes . 
whether 罗宾汉 i am , &quot; or &quot; i was working for volunteer fireman side , i saw a lot of very generous of kindness i also see a human courage and compassion can be a lot of different 
you know , i learned ? 
they all . 
when i look around , all of these successful or as successful people you have this amazing 激 赏 achievement and i want to remind you : don &apos;t wait . 
you don &apos;t wait to the first hundred million started to change other lives 
what if you have to be able to do now . 
whether it &apos;s a role model food supply the poor . 
it &apos;s not every day we all have the opportunity to save the life , but every day we all have the opportunity of the other person &apos;s life . 
come on , save that pair of shoes . 
thank you . 
Bruno Giussani：Mark , and come back , mark . 
thank you .
